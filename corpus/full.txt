Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea
This planet has — or rather had — a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time
Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place
And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place
This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever
This is not her story
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy — not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book
In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor — of which no Earthman had ever heard either
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one — more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects
First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover
But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply
It begins with a house
The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village
It stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland
Not a remarkable house by any means — it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in
He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable
He was about thirty as well, dark haired and never quite at ease with himself
The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about
He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought
It was, too — most of his friends worked in advertising
It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an bypass instead
At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good
He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash
Toothpaste on the brush — so
Scrub
Shaving mirror — pointing at the ceiling
He adjusted it
For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window
Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles
He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth
Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee
Yawn
The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with
The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one
He stared at it
Yellow, he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed
Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another
He began to suspect that he was hung over
Why was he hung over
Had he been drinking the night before
He supposed that he must have been
He caught a glint in the shaving mirror
Yellow, he thought and stomped on to the bedroom
He stood and thought
The pub, he thought
Oh dear, the pub
He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important
He'd been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces
Something about a new bypass he had just found out about
It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it
Ridiculous
He took a swig of water
It would sort itself out, he'd decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn't have a leg to stand on
It would sort itself out
God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though
He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror
He stuck out his tongue
Yellow, he thought
The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with
Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path
Mr L Prosser was, as they say, only human
In other words he was a carbon-based life form descended from an ape
More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council
Curiously enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats
He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man
Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job — which was to see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day was out
Come off it, Mr Dent,, he said, you can't win you know
You can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely
He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it
Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him
I'm game, he said, we'll see who rusts first
I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it, said Mr Prosser gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built
First I've heard of it, said Arthur, why's it going to be built
Mr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again
What do you mean, why's it got to be built
he said
It's a bypass
You've got to build bypasses
Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast
People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there
They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be
Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D
Point D wasn't anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C
He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D
His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes
He didn't know why - he just liked axes
He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each
Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him
Mr Prosser said: You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time you know
Appropriate time
hooted Arthur
Appropriate time
The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday
I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd come to demolish the house
He didn't tell me straight away of course
Oh no
First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver
Then he told me
But Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine month
Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon
You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you
I mean like actually telling anybody or anything
But the plans were on display
On display
I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them
That's the display department
With a torch
Ah, well the lights had probably gone
So had the stairs
But look, you found the notice didn't you
Yes, said Arthur, yes I did
It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard
A cloud passed overhead
It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud
It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent's house
Mr Prosser frowned at it
It's not as if it's a particularly nice house, he said
I'm sorry, but I happen to like it
You'll like the bypass
Oh shut up, said Arthur Dent
Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you
You haven't got a leg to stand on and you know it
Mr Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back
Mr Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous
He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together
Mr Dent, he said
Hello
Yes
said Arthur
Some factual information for you
Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you
How much
said Arthur
None at all, said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him
By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this
This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society — with, it must be said, some success
For instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research
The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name Ford Prefect as being nicely inconspicuous
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome
His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples
His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose
There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was
Perhaps it was that his eyes didn't blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf
Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one — an unruly boozer with some oddish habits
For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing
Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin
Oh, just looking for flying saucers, he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for
Green ones
he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks
Evenings like this usually ended badly
Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't matter that much really
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse
The policemen would usually say something like, Don't you think it's about time you went off home sir
I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to, is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all
The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts
Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth
Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them
He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day
In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine
It was Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage
The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course
The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in
A shadow moved across him again
Hello Arthur, said the shadow
Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him
Ford
Hello, how are you
Fine, said Ford, look, are you busy
Am I busy
exclaimed Arthur
Well, I've just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my house down if I don't, but other than that
well, no not especially, why
They don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating
He said, Good, is there anywhere we can talk
What
said Arthur Dent
For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car
Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur
We've got to talk, he said urgently
Fine, said Arthur, talk
And drink, said Ford
It's vitally important that we talk and drink
Now
We'll go to the pub in the village
He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant
Look, don't you understand
shouted Arthur
He pointed at Prosser
That man wants to knock my house down
Ford glanced at him, puzzled
Well he can do it while you're away can't he
he asked
But I don't want him to
Ah
Look, what's the matter with you Ford
said Arthur
Nothing
Nothing's the matter
Listen to me — I've got to tell you the most important thing you've ever heard
I've got to tell you now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom
But why
Because you are going to need a very stiff drink
Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his will was beginning to weaken
He didn't realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this: Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song Oh don't give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit)
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent — who would then have to drink it
The bottle would then be refilled
The game would be played again
And again
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological
Ford Prefect usually played to lose
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse and Groom after all
But what about my house
he asked plaintively
Ford looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him
He wants to knock your house down
Yes, he wants to build
And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers
Yes, and
I'm sure we can come to some arrangement, said Ford
Excuse me
he shouted
Mr Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around
He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had company
Yes
Hello
he called
Has Mr Dent come to his senses yet
Can we for the moment, called Ford, assume that he hasn't
Well
sighed Mr Prosser
And can we also assume, said Ford, that he's going to be staying here all day
So
So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing
Could be, could be
Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't actually need him to lie here all the time do you
What
You don't, said Ford patiently, actually need him here
Mr Prosser thought about this
Well no, not as such
he said, not exactly need
Prosser was worried
He thought that one of them wasn't making a lot of sense
Ford said, So if you would just like to take it as read that he's actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an hour
How does that sound
Mr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty
That sounds perfectly reasonable, he said in a reassuring tone of voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure
And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on, said Ford, we can always cover up for you in return
Thank you very much, said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how to play this at all, thank you very much, yes, that's very kind
He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head
He could only assume that he had just won
So, continued Ford Prefect, if you would just like to come over here and lie down
What
said Mr Prosser
Ah, I'm sorry, said Ford, perhaps I hadn't made myself fully clear
Somebody's got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven't they
Or there won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr Dent's house will there
What
said Mr Prosser again
It's very simple, said Ford, my client, Mr Dent, says that he will stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and take over from him
What are you talking about
said Arthur, but Ford nudged him with his shoe to be quiet
You want me, said Mr Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, to come and lie there
Yes
In front of the bulldozer
Yes
Instead of Mr Dent
Yes
In the mud
In, as you say it, the mud
As soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it
He sighed
In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down to the pub
That's it, said Ford
That's it exactly
Mr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped
Promise
Promise, said Ford
He turned to Arthur
Come on, he said to him, get up and let the man lie down
Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream
Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud
He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it
The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes
Ford looked at him severely
And no sneaky knocking down Mr Dent's house whilst he's away, alright
he said
The mere thought, growled Mr Prosser, hadn't even begun to speculate, he continued, settling himself back, about the merest possibility of crossing my mind
He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his eyes
He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard himself
He was far from certain about this — his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of blood
This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to himself
In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered
He began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids
Bureaucratic cock-ups, angry men lying in the mud, indecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head — what a day
What a day
Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of dingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not now
Arthur remained very worried
But can we trust him
he said
Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth, said Ford
Oh yes, said Arthur, and how far's that
About twelve minutes away, said Ford, come on, I need a drink
Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol
It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon-based life forms
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol
It says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster
It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick
The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards
The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself
Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit, it says
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V — Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says
Oh those Santraginean fish
Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost)
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia
Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger
Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink
Sprinkle Zamphuor
Add an olive
Drink
but
very carefully
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia Galactica
Six pints of bitter, said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and Groom
And quickly please, the world's about to end
The barman of the Horse and Groom didn't deserve this sort of treatment, he was a dignified old man
He pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at Ford Prefect
Ford ignored him and stared out of the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who shrugged helplessly and said nothing
So the barman said, Oh yes sir
Nice weather for it, and started pulling pints
He tried again
Going to watch the match this afternoon then
Ford glanced round at him
No, no point, he said, and looked back out of the window
What's that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir
said the barman
Arsenal without a chance
No, no, said Ford, it's just that the world's about to end
Oh yes sir, so you said, said the barman, looking over his glasses this time at Arthur
Lucky escape for Arsenal if it did
Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised
No, not really, he said
He frowned
The barman breathed in heavily
There you are sir, six pints, he said
Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again
He turned and smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had heard what was going on
None of them had, and none of them could understand what he was smiling at them for
A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them
Get off, said Ford, They're ours, giving him a look that would have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doing
Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar
He said, Keep the change
What, from a fiver
Thank you sir
You've got ten minutes left to spend it
The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit
Ford, said Arthur, would you please tell me what the hell is going on
Drink up, said Ford, you've got three pints to get through
Three pints
said Arthur
At lunchtime
The man next to ford grinned and nodded happily
Ford ignored him
He said, Time is an illusion
Lunchtime doubly so
Very deep, said Arthur, you should send that in to the Reader's Digest
They've got a page for people like you
Drink up
Why three pints all of a sudden
Muscle relaxant, you'll need it
Muscle relaxant
Muscle relaxant
Arthur stared into his beer
Did I do anything wrong today, he said, or has the world always been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice
Alright, said Ford, I'll try to explain
How long have we known each other
How long
Arthur thought
Er, about five years, maybe six, he said
Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time
Alright, said Ford
How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse
Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way
I don't know, he said, taking a pull of beer
Why — do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to say
Ford gave up
It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment, what with the world being about to end
He just said: Drink up
He added, perfectly factually: The world's about to end
Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile
The rest of the pub frowned at him
A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business
This must be Thursday, said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low over his beer, I never could get the hang of Thursdays
On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds
They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing
The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment
The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape  Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them — which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years
The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself
It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect wore habitually round his neck
The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top
Besides the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb — a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator
This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million pages could be summoned at a moment's notice
It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in large friendly letters
The other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor — The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in
Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels
A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have
Partly it has great practical value — you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value
For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc
etc
Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have lost
What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with
Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect
There's a frood who really knows where his towel is
Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy
Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly
Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out
At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea
You got a towel with you
said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur
Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him
Why
What, no
should I have
He had given up being surprised, there didn't seem to be any point any longer
Ford clicked his tongue in irritation
Drink up, he urged
At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky Ford had eventually bought him
Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet
What's that
he yelped
Don't worry, said Ford, they haven't started yet
Thank God for that, said Arthur and relaxed
It's probably just your house being knocked down, said Ford, drowning his last pint
What
shouted Arthur
Suddenly Ford's spell was broken
Arthur looked wildly around him and ran to the window
My God they are
They're knocking my house down
What the hell am I doing in the pub, Ford
It hardly makes any difference at this stage, said Ford, let them have their fun
Fun
yelped Arthur
Fun
He quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the same thing
Damn their fun
he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass
He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime
Stop, you vandals
You home wreckers
bawled Arthur
You half crazed Visigoths, stop will you
Ford would have to go after him
Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts
There you are sir, said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, twenty-eight pence if you'd be so kind
Ford was very kind — he gave the barman another five-pound note and told him to keep the change
The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford
He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before
In moments of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal
This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth
On Earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn't very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed
Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse
The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense of distance
He didn't know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe
Are you serious, sir
he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub
You think the world's going to end
Yes, said Ford
But, this afternoon
Ford had recovered himself
He was at his flippest
Yes, he said gaily, in less than two minutes I would estimate
The barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn't believe the sensation he had just had either
Isn't there anything we can do about it then
he said
No, nothing, said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets
Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become
The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now
His eyes waved their way up to Ford
I thought, he said, that if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something
If you like, yes, said Ford
That's what they told us in the army, said the man, and his eyes began the long trek back down to his whisky
Will that help
asked the barman
No, said Ford and gave him a friendly smile
Excuse me, he said, I've got to go
With a wave, he left
The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again
The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide
However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it
The barman cleared his throat
He heard himself say: Last orders, please
The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move faster
Ford knew they were there
This wasn't the way he had wanted it
Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house
He didn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice the wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain
He didn't notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home
You barbarians
he yelled
I'll sue the council for every penny it's got
I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered
And whipped
And boiled
until
until
until you've had enough
Ford was running after him very fast
Very very fast
And then I'll do it again
yelled Arthur
And when I've finished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on them
Arthur didn't notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he didn't notice that Mr Prosser was staring hectically into the sky
What Mr Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds
Impossibly huge yellow somethings
And I will carry on jumping on them, yelled Arthur, still running, until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then
Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back
At last he noticed that something was going on
His finger shot upwards
What the hell's that
he shrieked
Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your skull
Another one followed and did the same thing only louder
It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what they were doing themselves
None of it made a lot of sense — running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise
All around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit
Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears
He knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start
It was what he had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart
Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the Vogons
Still he knew what he had to do
As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he opened his satchel
He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was going
Everything was ready, everything was prepared
He knew where his towel was
A sudden silence hit the Earth
If anything it was worse than the noise
For a while nothing happened
The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on Earth
Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature
Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at
The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't
And still nothing happened
Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound
Every hi fi set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid-range driver in the world quietly turned itself on
Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board
Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built
But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message
People of Earth, your attention please, a voice said, and it was wonderful
Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep
This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, the voice continued
As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition
The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes
Thank you
The PA died away
Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth
The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them
Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was nowhere to flee to
Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again
It said: There's no point in acting all surprised about it
All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it now
The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land
The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power
On the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space
By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet
Nobody ever heard what they said, they only heard the reply
The PA slammed back into life again
The voice was annoyed
It said: What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri
For heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know
I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout
Energize the demolition beams
Light poured out into the hatchways
I don't know, said the voice on the PA, apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all
It cut off
There was a terrible ghastly silence
There was a terrible ghastly noise
There was a terrible ghastly silence
The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void
Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun
Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of
Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold
The boat sped on across the water
It would be some time before it reached its destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet
It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean
The boat sped on
Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always remained a deserted planet
This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret
The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet
Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence — in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France
One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences
But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox
It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy — Zaphod Beeblebrox
President
Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox
Not the President
Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas
Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed
Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook
quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch
President
No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least
Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency fodder \footnote{ President: full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government

What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it
He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun
Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod had been up to
Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's Presidency was all about
Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence
As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be
He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the seat back
He steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing
Hey, he cooed to himself, you're a real cool boy you
But his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle
The island  of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across the middle, sandy and crescent shaped
In fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay
This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs
From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the opposite shore
On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee
It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold — mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph-like maximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the color blue)
All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi-colored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion
There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them
Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck
An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore
It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all
Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it
Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job
The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay
It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns
In fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms — but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water
They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming into the boat's wake as it careered across the bay
Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at
He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves
Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion people
The three billion people weren't actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby
The antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri-D; that's what they were for
He grinned again
Three billion and six people didn't know it, but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for
The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two heads and he waved again
He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm
His fair tousled hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost always unshaven
A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun
Inside it floated a wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock
Again, all done for effect as much as anything
Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa
He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee
His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up
At any moment, he thought, he might scream
Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted
The bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout
Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff
Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below
Zaphod smiled, picturing himself
A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one
At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt
To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light
The President of the Galaxy had arrived
He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in greeting
Hi, he said
A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands
Pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay
Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented
It was constructed largely of papier m@ch@ and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it
The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it
Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider
Hi, he said again
Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone
He singled out Trillian from the crowd
Trillian was a gird that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito
She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes
With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic
Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab of course
The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years from Damogran
Trillian wasn't anybody in particular, or so Zaphod claimed
She just went around with him rather a lot and told him what she thought of him
Hi honey, he said to her
She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away
Then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly — but by this time he was looking at something else
Hi, he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes
He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote
The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them
One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket
Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground
Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they had built it that way
Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mindboggingly beautiful
At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried within it the most brain-wretching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named — The Heart of Gold
Wow, said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold
There wasn't much else he could say
He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press
Wow
The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly
He winked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him
She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible showoff
That is really amazing, he said
That really is truly amazing
That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it
A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form
The crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned
As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket
Finally he could bear it no more
He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons
His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead
His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects
Not that he ever went swimming of course
His busy schedule would not allow it
He was the way he was because billions of years ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet's virgin shores
when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution ad simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake
They never evolved again; they should never have survived
The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures
Evolution
they said to themselves, Who needs it
and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery
Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder
They brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on
They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway
Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel
Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service
They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears
Every year they import twenty-seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile
Also, he did not like hitch hikers
Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared nervously
The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous
His name was Ford Prefect \footnote{Ford Prefect's original name is only pronuncible in an obscure Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal
Sid
Year 03758 which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven
Ford's father was the only man on the entire planet to survive the Great Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able satisfactorily to explain
The whole episode is shrouded in deep mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly
Ford's father, magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of his now dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue

He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet
He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis
The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves
This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves
The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon
It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide
He heard a slight groan
By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor
Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out
He crouched on the floor
The shape moved again
Ford Prefect said: I bought some peanuts
Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently
Here, have some, urged Ford, shaking the packet again, if you've never been through a matter transference beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein
The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit
Whhhrrrr
said Arthur Dent
He opened his eyes
It's dark, he said
Yes, said Ford Prefect, it's dark
No light, said Arthur Dent
Dark, no light
One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or You're very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright
At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour
If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up
After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one
If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working
After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn't know about
Yes, he agreed with Arthur, no light
He helped Arthur to some peanuts
How do you feel
he asked
Like a military academy, said Arthur, bits of me keep on passing out
Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness
If I asked you where the hell we were, said Arthur weakly, would I regret it
Ford stood up
We're safe, he said
Oh good, said Arthur
We're in a small galley cabin, said Ford, in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet
Ah, said Arthur, this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware of
Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch
Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again
Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively
Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing
How did we get here
he asked, shivering slightly
We hitched a lift, said Ford
Excuse me
said Arthur
Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in
I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout
Well, said Ford, the Thumb's an electronic sub-etha signalling device, the roundabout's at Barnard's Star six light years away, but otherwise, that's more or less right
And the bug-eyed monster
Is green, yes
Fine, said Arthur, when can I get home
You can't, said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch
Shade your eyes
he said, and turned it on
Even Ford was surprised
Good grief, said Arthur, is this really the interior of a flying saucer
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge
He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets
He wished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better
He flopped as heavily as he could on to his control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak
Go away
he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge at that moment
The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved
He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered the report they'd just received
The report was an official release which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes unnecessary
Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the Dentrassis prepared his meals
A meal would be most welcome
A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray
It was grinning like a maniac
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted
He knew that when a Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about
Ford and Arthur stared about them
Well, what do you think
said Ford
It's a bit squalid, isn't it
Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin
Well, this is a working ship, you see, said Ford
These are the Dentrassi sleeping quarters
I thought you said they were called Vogons or something
Yes, said Ford, the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks, they let us on board
I'm confused, said Arthur
Here, have a look at this, said Ford
He sat down on one of the mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel
Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being put to service
Very few have ever come to life again
Ford handed the book to Arthur
What is it
asked Arthur
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
It's a sort of electronic book
It tells you everything you need to know about anything
That's its job
Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands
I like the cover, he said
Don't Panic
It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day
I'll show you how it works, said Ford
He snatched it from Arthur who was still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark and pulled it out of its cover
You press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving you the index
A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to flicker across the surface
You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so
His fingers tapped some more keys
And there we are
The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen
Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it
At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice
This is what the book said
Vogon Constructor Fleets
Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it
They are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy — not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous
They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat and recycled as firelighters
The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal
On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you
Arthur blinked at it
What a strange book
How did we get a lift then
That's the point, it's out of date now, said Ford, sliding the book back into its cover
I'm doing the field research for the New Revised Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include is a bit about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather useful little loophole
A pained expression crossed Arthur's face
But who are the Dentrassi
he said
Great guys, said Ford
They're the best cooks and the best drink mixers and they don't give a wet slap about anything else
And they'll always help hitch hikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons
Which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you're an impoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day
And that's my job
Fun, isn't it
Arthur looked lost
It's amazing, he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses
Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended, said Ford
I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years
But how did you get there in the first place then
Easy, I got a lift with a teaser
A teaser
Yeah
Er, what is
A teaser
Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do
They cruise around looking for planets which haven't made interstellar contact yet and buzz them
Buzz them
Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life difficult for him
Yeah, said Ford, they buzz them
They find some isolated spot with very few people around, then land right by some poor soul whom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making beep beep noises
Rather childish really
Ford leant back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with himself
Ford, insisted Arthur, I don't know if this sounds like a silly question, but what am I doing here
Well you know that, said Ford
I rescued you from the Earth
And what's happened to the Earth
Ah
It's been demolished
Has it, said Arthur levelly
Yes
It just boiled away into space
Look, said Arthur, I'm a bit upset about that
Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his mind
Yes, I can understand that, he said at last
Understand that
shouted Arthur
Understand that
Ford sprang up
Keep looking at the book
he hissed urgently
What
Don't Panic
I'm not panicking
Yes you are
Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do
You just come along with me and have a good time
The Galaxy's a fun place
You'll need to have this fish in your ear
I beg your pardon
asked Arthur, rather politely he thought
Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish wriggling around in it
Arthur blinked at him
He wished there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of
He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the piles of Squornshellous mattresses and the man from Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of corn flakes
He couldn't, and he didn't feel safe
Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he could identify
He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves
Shush
said Ford
Listen, it might be important
Im
important
It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy
You mean that's how the Vogons talk
Listen
But I can't speak Vogon
You don't need to
Just put that fish in your ear
Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's ear, and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep into his aural tract
Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned goggle-eyed with wonder
He was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick
Or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of glasses
He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only now it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward English
This is what he heard
Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a good time
Message repeats
This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention
First of all I see from our instruments that we have a couple of hitchhikers aboard
Hello wherever you are
I just want to make it totally clear that you are not at all welcome
I worked hard to get where I am today, and I didn't become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders
I have sent out a search party, and as soon that they find you I will put you off the ship
If you're very lucky I might read you some of my poetry first
Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to Barnard's Star
On arrival we will stay in dock for a seventy-two hour refit, and no one's to leave the ship during that time
I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled
I've just had an unhappy love affair, so I don't see why anybody else should have a good time
Message ends
The noise stopped
Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head
He smiled weakly
Charming man, he said
I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one
You wouldn't need to, said Ford
They've got as much sex appeal as a road accident
No, don't move, he added as Arthur began to uncurl himself, you'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace
It's unpleasantly like being drunk
What's so unpleasant about being drunk
You ask a glass of water
Arthur thought about this
Ford, he said
Yeah
What's this fish doing in my ear
It's translating for you
It's a Babel fish
Look it up in the book if you like
He tossed over The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then curled himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the jump
At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind
His eyes turned inside out
His feet began to leak out of the top of his head
The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own navel
They were passing through hyperspace
The Babel fish, said The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy quietly, is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe
It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but from those around it
It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with
It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them
The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language
The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish
Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God
The argument goes something like this: `I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, `for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing
But,' says Man, `The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it
It could not have evolved by chance
It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't
QED

Oh dear,' says God, `I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic
Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing
Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God
Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the history of creation
Arthur let out a low groan
He was horrified to discover that the kick through hyperspace hadn't killed him
He was now six light years from the place that the Earth would have been if it still existed
The Earth
Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind
There was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth having gone, it was too big
He prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone
No reaction
He thought of all the people he had been close to
No reaction
Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden stab — the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone
Nelson's Column had gone
Nelson's Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was no one left to make an outcry
From now on Nelson's Column only existed in his mind
England only existed in his mind — his mind, stuck here in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship
A wave of claustrophobia closed in on him
England no longer existed
He'd got that — somehow he'd got it
He tried again
America, he thought, has gone
He couldn't grasp it
He decided to start smaller again
New York has gone
No reaction
He'd never seriously believed it existed anyway
The dollar, he thought, had sunk for ever
Slight tremor there
Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock
McDonalds, he thought
There is no longer any such thing as a McDonald's hamburger
He passed out
When he came round a second later he found he was sobbing for his mother
He jerked himself violently to his feet
Ford
Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to himself
He always found the actual travelling-through-space part of space travel rather trying
Yeah
he said
If you're a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth, you must have been gathering material on it
Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes
Let me see what it says in this edition then, I've got to see it
Yeah OK
He passed it over again
Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking
He pressed the entry for the relevant page
The screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print
Arthur stared at it
It doesn't have an entry
he burst out
Ford looked over his shoulder
Yes it does, he said, down there, see at the bottom of the screen, just under Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6
Arthur followed Ford's finger, and saw where it was pointing
For a moment it still didn't register, then his mind nearly blew up
What
Harmless
Is that all it's got to say
Harmless
One word
Ford shrugged
Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors, he said, and no one knew much about the Earth of course
Well for God's sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit
Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor
He had to trim it a bit, but it's still an improvement
And what does it say now
asked Arthur
Mostly harmless, admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough
Mostly harmless
shouted Arthur
What was that noise
hissed Ford
It was me shouting, shouted Arthur
No
Shut up
said Ford
I think we're in trouble
You think we're in trouble
Outside the door were the sounds of marching feet
The Dentrassi
whispered Arthur
No, those are steel tipped boots, said Ford
There was a sharp ringing rap on the door
Then who is it
said Arthur
Well, said Ford, if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to throw us in to space
And if we're unlucky
If we're unlucky, said Ford grimly, the captain might be serious in his threat that he's going to read us some of his poetry first
Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe
The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria
During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem Ode To A Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer Morning four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off
Grunthos is reported to have been disappointed by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain
The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in the destruction of the planet Earth
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly
This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements
He had had a terribly therapeutic yell at his prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little callousness
The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs — strapped in
Vogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were generally held in
Their early attempts at composition had been part of bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved and cultured race, but now the only thing that kept them going was sheer bloodymindedness
The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round the electrodes strapped to his temples
These were attached to a battery of electronic equipment — imagery intensifiers, rhythmic modulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers — all designed to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure that not a single nuance of the poet's thought was lost
Arthur Dent sat and quivered
He had no idea what he was in for, but he knew that he hadn't liked anything that had happened so far and didn't think things were likely to change
The Vogon began to read — a fetid little passage of his own devising
Oh frettled gruntbuggly
he began
Spasms wracked Ford's body — this was worse than ever he'd been prepared for
thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee
Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh
went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head back as lumps of pain thumped through it
He could dimly see beside him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat
He clenched his teeth
Groop I implore thee, continued the merciless Vogon, my foonting turlingdromes
His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency
And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,| Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't
Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh
cried Ford Prefect and threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of the last line caught him full blast across the temples
He went limp
Arthur lolled
Now Earthlings
whirred the Vogon (he didn't know that Ford Prefect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and wouldn't have cared if he had) I present you with a simple choice
Either die in the vacuum of space, or
he paused for melodramatic effect, tell me how good you thought my poem was
He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat-shaped seat and watched them
He did the smile again
Ford was rasping for breath
He rolled his dusty tongue round his parched mouth and moaned
Arthur said brightly: Actually I quite liked it
Ford turned and gaped
Here was an approach that had quite simply not occurred to him
The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his nose and was therefore no bad thing
Oh good
he whirred, in considerable astonishment
Oh yes, said Arthur, I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly effective
Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts around this totally new concept
Were they really going to be able to bareface their way out of this
Yes, do continue
invited the Vogon
Oh
and er
interesting rhythmic devices too, continued Arthur, which seemed to counterpoint the
er
er
He floundered
Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the
er
He floundered too, but Arthur was ready again
humanity of the
Vogonity, Ford hissed at him
Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet's compassionate soul, Arthur felt he was on a home stretch now, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other, (he was reaching a triumphant crescendo
and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into
into
er

which suddenly gave out on him
Ford leaped in with the coup de gr@ce: Into whatever it was the poem was about
he yelled
Out of the corner of his mouth: Well done, Arthur, that was very good
The Vogon perused them
For a moment his embittered racial soul had been touched, but he thought no — too little too late
His voice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon
So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved, he said
He paused
Is that right
Ford laughed a nervous laugh
Well I mean yes, he said, don't we all, deep down, you know
er
The Vogon stood up
No, well you're completely wrong, he said, I just write poetry to throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief
I'm going to throw you off the ship anyway
Guard
Take the prisoners to number three airlock and throw them out
What
shouted Ford
A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery arms
You can't throw us into space, yelled Ford, we're trying to write a book
Resistance is useless
shouted the Vogon guard back at him
It was the first phrase he'd learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard Corps
The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away
Arthur stared round him wildly
I don't want to die now
he yelled
I've still got a headache
I don't want to go to heaven with a headache, I'd be all cross and wouldn't enjoy it
The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing deferentially towards his captain's back, hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge
A steel door closed and the captain was on his own again
He hummed quietly and mused to himself, lightly fingering his notebook of verses
Hmmmm, he said, counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor
He considered this for a moment, and then closed the book with a grim smile
Death's too good for them, he said
The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpits
This is great, spluttered Arthur, this is really terrific
Let go of me you brute
The Vogon guard dragged them on
Don't you worry, said Ford, I'll think of something
He didn't sound hopeful
Resistance is useless
bellowed the guard
Just don't say things like that, stammered Ford
How can anyone maintain a positive mental attitude if you're saying things like that
My God, complained Arthur, you're talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today
I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog
It's now just after four in the afternoon and I'm already thrown out of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth
He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip
Alright, said Ford, just stop panicking
Who said anything about panicking
snapped Arthur
This is still just the culture shock
You wait till I've settled down into the situation and found my bearings
Then I'll start panicking
Arthur you're getting hysterical
Shut up
Ford tried desperately to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again
Resistance is useless
And you can shut up as well
snapped Ford
Resistance is useless
Oh give it a rest, said Ford
He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captor's face
A thought struck him
Do you really enjoy this sort of thing
he asked suddenly
The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over his face
Enjoy
he boomed
What do you mean
What I mean, said Ford, is does it give you a full satisfying life
Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships
The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled over each other
His mouth slacked
Finally he said, Well the hours are good
They'd have to be, agreed Ford
Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford
Ford, what are you doing
he asked in an amazed whisper
Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK
he said
So the hours are pretty good then
he resumed
The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths
Yeah, he said, but now you come to mention it, most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy
Except
he thought again, which required looking at the ceiling — except some of the shouting I quite like
He filled his lungs and bellowed, Resistance is
Sure, yes, interrupted Ford hurriedly, you're good at that, I can tell
But if it's mostly lousy, he said, slowly giving the words time to reach their mark, then why do you do it
What is it
The girls
The leather
The machismo
Or do you just find that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge
Er
said the guard, er
er
I dunno
I think I just sort of
do it really
My aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a young Vogon — you know, the uniform, the low-slung stun ray holster, the mindless tedium
There you are Arthur, said Ford with the air of someone reaching the conclusion of his argument, you think you've got problems
Arthur rather thought he had
Apart from the unpleasant business with his home planet the Vogon guard had half-throttled him already and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space very much
Try and understand his problem, insisted Ford
Here he is poor lad, his entire life's work is stamping around, throwing people off spaceships
And shouting, added the guard
And shouting, sure, said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round his neck in friendly condescension,
and he doesn't even know why he's doing it
Arthur agreed this was very sad
He did this with a small feeble gesture, because he was too asphyxicated to speak
Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard
Well
Now you put it like that I suppose
Good lad
encouraged Ford
But alright, went on the rumblings, so what's the alternative
Well, said Ford, brightly but slowly, stop doing it of course
Tell them, he went on, you're not going to do it anymore
He felt he had to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that much
Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
said the guard, erm, well that doesn't sound that great to me
Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away
Now wait a minute, he said, that's just the start you see, there's more to it than that you see
But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock
He was obviously quite touched
No, I think if it's all the same to you, he said, I'd better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting I've got to do
It wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect after all
Come on now
but look
he said, less slowly, less brightly
Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn
said Arthur without any clear inflection
But hang on, pursued Ford, there's music and art and things to tell you about yet
Arrrggghhh
Resistance is useless, bellowed the guard, and then added, You see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non-shouting and non-pushing-people-about officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I know
They had now reached the airlock — a large circular steel hatchway of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft
The guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open
But thanks for taking an interest, said the Vogon guard
Bye now
He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within
Arthur lay panting for breath
Ford scrambled round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway
But listen, he shouted to the guard, there's a whole world you don't know anything about
here how about this
Desperately he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand — he hummed the first bar of Beethoven's Fifth
Da da da dum
Doesn't that stir anything in you
No, said the guard, not really
But I'll mention it to my aunt
If he said anything further after that it was lost
The hatchway sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of the ship's engines
They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diameter and ten feet long
Potentially bright lad I thought, he said and slumped against the curved wall
Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen
He didn't look up
He just lay panting
We're trapped now aren't we
Yes, said Ford, we're trapped
Well didn't you think of anything
I thought you said you were going to think of something
Perhaps you thought of something and didn't notice
Oh yes, I thought of something, panted Ford
Arthur looked up expectantly
But unfortunately, continued Ford, it rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway
He kicked the hatch they'd just been through
But it was a good idea was it
Oh yes, very neat
What was it
Well I hadn't worked out the details yet
Not much point now is there
So
er, what happens next
Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect and asphyxicate
If you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty seconds of course
said Ford
He stuck his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old Betelgeusian battle hymn
To Arthur's eyes he suddenly looked very alien
So this is it, said Arthur, we're going to die
Yes, said Ford, except
no
Wait a minute
he suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision
What's this switch
he cried
What
Where
cried Arthur twisting round
No, I was only fooling, said Ford, we are going to die after all
He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he left off
You know, said Arthur, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxication in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young
Why, what did she tell you
I don't know, I didn't listen
Oh
Ford carried on humming
This is terrific, Arthur thought to himself, Nelson's Column has gone, McDonald's have gone, all that's left is me and the words Mostly Harmless
Any second now all that will be left is Mostly Harmless
And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well
A motor whirred
A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny impossibly bright points of light
Ford and Arthur popped into outer space like corks from a toy gun
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book
It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many different editorships
It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and researchers
The introduction begins like this: Space, it says, is big
Really big
You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is
I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space
Listen
and so on
After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally important to get a receipt
To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances between the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide's introduction have faltered
Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts
The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination
Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars
It takes eight minutes from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol's nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima
For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand years
The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five years, but you don't get to see much on the way
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds
However it goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against
By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with — she went off with a gatecrasher
Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued
A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason
This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch
A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy
It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years from end to end
As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe
A team of seven three-foot-high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxication, partly of surprise
Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too, materializing in a large woobly heap on the famine-struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system
The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later
The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion
Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns
These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary of the patterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to
That was how life began in the Universe
Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed up a pavement
On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half-spent fish
There you are, gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the pavement as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, I told you I'd think of something
Oh sure, said Arthur, sure
Bright idea of mine, said Ford, to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it
The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them
Various pretend ones flitted silently by, like mountain goats
Primal light exploded, splattering space-time as with gobbets of junket
Time blossomed, matter shrank away
The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever
Oh come off it, said Arthur, the chances against it were astronomical
Don't knock it, it worked, said Ford
What sort of ship are we in
asked Arthur as the pit of eternity yawned beneath them
I don't know, said Ford, I haven't opened my eyes yet
No, nor have I, said Arthur
The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unexpected directions
Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise
Good god, said Arthur, it looks just like the sea front at Southend
Hell, I'm relieved to hear you say that, said Ford
Why
Because I thought I must be going mad
Perhaps you are
Perhaps you only thought I said it
Ford thought about this
Well, did you say it or didn't you
he asked
I think so, said Arthur
Well, perhaps we're both going mad
Yes, said Arthur, we'd be mad, all things considered, to think this was Southend
Well, do you think this is Southend
Oh yes
So do I
Therefore we must be mad
Nice day for it
Yes, said a passing maniac
Who was that
asked Arthur Who — the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers
Yes
I don't know
Just someone
Ah
They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the Uncertain Areas
You know, said Arthur with a slight cough, if this is Southend, there's something very odd about it
You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep washing up and down
said Ford
Yes I thought that was odd too
In fact, he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six equal segments which danced and span giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formation, there is something altogether very strange going on
Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid fish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for it
They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats and suddenly heard a girl's voice
It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling, and that was all
Ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a source for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe in
What was that voice
shouted Arthur
I don't know, yelled Ford, I don't know
It sounded like a measurement of probability
Probability
What do you mean
Probability
You know, like two to one, three to one, five to four against
It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against
That's pretty improbable you know
A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning
But what does it mean
cried Arthur
What, the custard
No, the measurement of probability
I don't know
I don't know at all
I think we're on some kind of spaceship
I can only assume, said Arthur, that this is not the first-class compartment
Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time
Great ugly bulges
Haaaauuurrgghhh
said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions
Southend seems to be melting away
the stars are swirling
a dustbowl
my legs are drifting off into the sunset
my left arm's come off too
A frightening thought struck him: Hell, he said, how am I going to operate my digital watch now
He wound his eyes desperately around in Ford's direction
Ford, he said, you're turning into a penguin
Stop it
Again came the voice
Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and falling
Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle
Hey, who are you, he quacked
Where are you
What's going on and is there any way of stopping it
Please relax, said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire, you are perfectly safe
But that's not the point
raged Ford
The point is that I am now a perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs
It's alright, I've got them back now, said Arthur
Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling, said the voice
Admittedly, said Arthur, they're longer than I usually like them, but
Isn't there anything, squawked Ford in avian fury, you feel you ought to be telling us
The voice cleared its throat
A giant petit four lolloped off into the distance
Welcome, the voice said, to the Starship Heart of Gold
The voice continued
Please do not be alarmed, it said, by anything you see or hear around you
You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against — possibly much higher
We are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway
Thank you
Two to the power of twenty thousand to one against and falling
The voice cut out
Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle
Ford was wildly excited
Arthur
he said, this is fantastic
We've been picked up by a ship powered by the Infinite   Improbability Drive
This is incredible
I heard rumors about it before
They were all officially denied, but they must have done it
They've built the Improbability   Drive
Arthur, this is
Arthur
What's happening
Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying to hold it closed, but it was ill fitting
Tiny furry little hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers were inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely
Arthur looked up
Ford
he said, there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out
The Infinite   Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace
It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's research team on Damogran
This, briefly, is the story of its discovery
The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood — and such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy
Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand for this — partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties
Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mind-paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible
Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way: If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability
So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea
and turn it on
He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability generator out of thin air
It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smartass
The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new
Some of the control seats hadn't had the plastic wrapping taken off yet
The cabin was mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish restaurant
In fact it wasn't perfectly oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes
The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three-dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have got miserable
As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex wall
In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees
It too was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid body didn't quite fit properly
In fact they fitted perfectly well, but something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better
Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement
Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off figures
Her voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the whole ship
Five to one against and falling
she said, four to one against and falling
three to one
two
one
probability factor of one to one
we have normality, I repeat we have normality
She turned her microphone off — then turned it back on, with a slight smile and continued: Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem
Please relax
You will be sent for soon
Zaphod burst out in annoyance: Who are they Trillian
Trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged
Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space, she said
Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha
Yeah, well that's a very sweet thought Trillian, complained Zaphod, but do you really think it's wise under the circumstances
I mean, here we are on the run and everything, we must have the police of half the Galaxy after us by now, and we stop to pick up hitch hikers
OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, yeah
He tapped irritably at a control panel
Trillian quietly moved his hand before he tapped anything important
Whatever Zaphod's qualities of mind might include — dash, bravado, conceit — he was mechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture
Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he never really understood the significance of anything he did
Zaphod, she said patiently, they were floating unprotected in open space
you wouldn't want them to have died would you
Well, you know
no
Not as such, but
Not as such
Not die as such
But
Trillian cocked her head on one side
Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later
A second later and they would have been dead
Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a bit longer it would have gone away
You'd been happy to let them die
Well, you know, not happy as such, but
Anyway, said Trillian, turning back to the controls, I didn't pick them up
What do you mean
Who picked them up then
The ship did
Huh
The ship did
All by itself
Huh
Whilst we were in Improbability Drive
But that's incredible
No Zaphod
Just very very improbable
Er, yeah
Look Zaphod, she said, patting his arm, don't worry about the aliens
They're just a couple of guys I expect
I'll send the robot down to get them and bring them up here
Hey Marvin
In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about imperceptibly
It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room
It stopped in front of Trillian and seemed to stare through her left shoulder
I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed, it said
Its voice was low and hopeless
Oh God, muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat
Well, said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, here's something to occupy you and keep your mind off things
It won't work, droned Marvin, I have an exceptionally large mind
Marvin
warned Trillian
Alright, said Marvin, what do you want me to do
Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here under surveillance
With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre — nothing you could actually take offence at — Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human
Just that
he said
Yes, said Trillian firmly
I won't enjoy it, said Marvin
Zaphod leaped out of his seat
She's not asking you to enjoy it, he shouted, just do it will you
Alright, said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell, I'll do it
Good
snapped Zaphod, great
thank you
Marvin turned and lifted his flat-topped triangular red eyes up towards him
I'm not getting you down at all am I
he said pathetically
No no Marvin, lilted Trillian, that's just fine, really
I wouldn't like to think that I was getting you down
No, don't worry about that, the lilt continued, you just act as comes naturally and everything will be just fine
You're sure you don't mind
probed Marvin
No no Marvin, lilted Trillian, that's just fine, really
just part of life
Marvin flashed him an electronic look
Life, said Marvin, don't talk to me about life
He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the cabin
With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind him I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod, growled Trillian
The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man
The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun To Be With
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes, with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics correspondent
Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came
The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had sunk away to a better dimension
Ford and Arthur found themselves in the embarkation area of the ship
It was rather smart
I think the ship's brand new, said Ford
How can you tell
asked Arthur
Have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal
No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor
It's a lot of `the Universe can be yours' stuff
Ah
Look, I was right
Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur
It says: Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics
As soon as the ship's drive reaches Infinite Improbability it passes through every point in the Universe
Be the envy of other major governments
Wow, this is big league stuff
Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read — clearly Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his exile
Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel
The panel lit up with the words Please do not press this button again
He shook himself
Listen, said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, they make a big thing of the ship's cybernetics
A new generation of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers, with the new GPP feature
GPP feature
said Arthur
What's that
Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities
Oh, said Arthur, sounds ghastly
A voice behind them said, It is
The voice was low and hopeless and accompanied by a slight clanking sound
They span round and saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway
What
they said
Ghastly, continued Marvin, it all is
Absolutely ghastly
Just don't even talk about it
Look at this door, he said, stepping through it
The irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure
All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition
It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done
As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied sigh-like quality to it
Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah
it said
Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother
What's the point
Nothing is worth getting involved in
Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids' brain cells
For a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom
A spasm of despair shook the robot's body as he turned
Come on, he droned, I've been ordered to take you down to the bridge
Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge
Call that job satisfaction
Cos I don't
He turned and walked back to the hated door
Er, excuse me, said Ford following after him, which government owns this ship
Marvin ignored him
You watch this door, he muttered, it's about to open again
I can tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates
With an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and Marvin stomped through
Come on, he said
The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with pleased little clicks and whirrs
Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, said Marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming curved corridor that stretched out before them
Let's build robots with Genuine People Personalities, they said
So they tried it out with me
I'm a personality prototype
You can tell can't you
Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers
I hate that door, continued Marvin
I'm not getting you down at all am I
Which government
started Ford again
No government owns it, snapped the robot, it's been stolen
Stolen
Stolen
mimicked Marvin
Who by
asked Ford
Zaphod Beeblebrox
Something extraordinary happened to Ford's face
At least five entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement piled up on it in a jumbled mess
His left leg, which was in mid stride, seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again
He stared at the robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles
Zaphod Beeblebrox
he said weakly
Sorry, did I say something wrong
said Marvin, dragging himself on regardless
Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed
Here's another of those self-satisfied door
Life
Don't talk to me about life
No one ever mentioned it, muttered Arthur irritably
Ford, are you alright
Ford stared at him
Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox
he said
A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold cabin as Zaphod searched the sub-etha radio wavebands for news of himself
The machine was rather difficult to operate
For years radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were made touch-sensitive — you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope
It saved a lot of muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme
Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again
More gunk music, but this time it was a background to a news announcement
The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music
and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band, broadcasting around the galaxy around the clock, squawked a voice, and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere
and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys
And of course, the big news story tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability   Drive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox
And the question everyone's asking is
has the big Z finally flipped
Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, ex-confidence trickster, once described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One, and recently voted the Wort Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known Universe for the seventh time
has he got an answer this time
We asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt
The music swirled and dived for a moment
Another voice broke in, presumably Halfrunt
He said: Vell, Zaphod's jist zis guy you know
but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radio's on/off sensitive airspace
Zaphod turned and glared at Trillian — she had thrown the pencil
Hey, he said, what do you do that for
Trillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures
I've just thought of something, she said
Yeah
Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for
You hear enough about yourself as it is
I'm very insecure
We know that
Can we drop your ego for a moment
This is important
If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now
Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed
Listen, she said, we picked up those couple of guys
What couple of guys
The couple of guys we picked up
Oh, yeah, said Zaphod, those couple of guys
We picked them up in sector ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha
Yeah
said Zaphod and blinked
Trillian said quietly, Does that mean anything to you
Mmmmm, said Zaphod, ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha
ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha
Well
said Trillian
Er
what does the Z mean
said Zaphod
Which one
Any one
One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid
He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so — but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the act
He proffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous
This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it
She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way
There, she pointed, right there
Hey
Yeah
said Zaphod
Well
she said
Well what
Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the inside of her head
She said, very calmly, It's the same sector you originally picked me up in
He looked at her and then looked back at the screen
Hey, yeah, he said, now that is wild
We should have zapped straight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula
How did we come to be there
I mean that's nowhere
She ignored this
Improbability   Drive, she said patiently
You explained it to me yourself
We pass through every point in the Universe, you know that
Yeah, but that's one wild coincidence isn't it
Yes
Picking someone up at that point
Out of the whole of the Universe to choose from
That's just too
I want to work this out
Computer
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which controlled and permeated every particle of the ship switched into communication mode
Hi there
it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of ticker tape just for the record
The ticker tape said, Hi there
Oh God, said Zaphod
He hadn't worked with this computer for long but had already learned to loathe it
The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling detergent
I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help you solve it
Yeah yeah, said Zaphod
Look, I think I'll just use a piece of paper
Sure thing, said the computer, spilling out its message into a waste bin at the same time, I understand
If you ever want
Shut up
said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next to Trillian at the console
OK, OK
said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed down its speech channel again
Zaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability flight path scanner flashed silently up in front of them
Can we work out, said Zaphod, from their point of view what the Improbability of their rescue was
Yes, that's a constant, said Trillian, two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and nine to one against
That's high
They're two lucky lucky guys
Yes
But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up
Trillian punched up the figures
They showed tow-to-the power-of-Infinity-minus-one (an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in Improbability physics)
it's pretty low, continued Zaphod with a slight whistle
Yes, agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically
That's one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for
Something pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance sheet if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum
Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the pencil away
Bat's dots, I can't work it out
Well
Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth
OK, he said
Computer
The voice circuits sprang to life again
Why hello there
they said (ticker tape, ticker tape)
All I want to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer
Yeah well shut up and work something out for me
Sure thing, chattered the computer, you want a probability forecast based on
Improbability data, yeah
OK, the computer continued
Here's an interesting little notion
Did you realize that most people's lives are governed by telephone numbers
A pained look crawled across one of Zaphod's faces and on to the other one
Have you flipped
he said
No, but you will when I tell you that
Trillian gasped
She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability flight path screen
Telephone number
she said
Did that thing say telephone number
Numbers flashed up on the screen
The computer had paused politely, but now it continued
What I was about to say was that
Don't bother please, said Trillian
Look, what is this
said Zaphod
I don't know, said Trillian, but those aliens — they're on the way up to the bridge with that wretched robot
Can we pick them up on any monitor cameras
Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning
and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side
No
said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him
Really
Oh yes, said Marvin, I mean I've asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens
I can imagine
Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford
Well well well, he kept saying to himself, Zaphod Beeblebrox
Suddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand
You know what's happened now of course
No, what
said Arthur, who didn't what to know
We've arrived at another of those doors
There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor
Marvin eyed it suspiciously
Well
said Ford impatiently
Do we go through
Do we go through
mimicked Marvin
Yes
This is the entrance to the bridge
I was told to take you to the bridge
Probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today I shouldn't wonder
Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a hunter stalking his prey
Suddenly it slid open
Thank you, it said, for making a simple door very happy
Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground
Funny, he intoned funerally, how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does
He heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur staring at each other and shrugging their shoulders
From inside they heard Marvin's voice again
I suppose you want to see the aliens now, he said
Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm standing
Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin
came another voice
Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing
What's
Shhh, said Ford, come in
He stepped through into the bridge
Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console picking the teeth in his right-hand head with his left hand
The right-hand head seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this task, but the left-hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed, nonchalant grin
The number of things that Arthur couldn't believe he was seeing was fairly large
His jaw flapped about at a loose end for a while
The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling affectation of nonchalance said, Ford, hi, how are you
Glad you could drop in
Ford was not going to be outcooled
Zaphod, he drawled, great to see you, you're looking well, the extra arm suits you
Nice ship you've stolen
Arthur goggled at him
You mean you know this guy
he said, waving a wild finger at Zaphod
Know him
exclaimed Ford, he's
he paused, and decided to do the introductions the other way round
Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent, he said, I saved him when his planet blew up
Oh sure, said Zaphod, hi Arthur, glad you could make it
His right-hand head looked round casually, said hi and went back to having his teeth picked
Ford carried on
And Arthur, he said, this is my semi-cousin Zaphod Beeb
We've met, said Arthur sharply
When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from fourth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off your stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect off his
Err
what
I said we've met
Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply
Hey
er, have we
Hey
er
Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes
Now he felt he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as much about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life in Peking
What do you mean you've met
he demanded
This is Zaphod Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon
I don't care, said Arthur coldly
We've met, haven't we Zaphod Beeblebrox - or should I say
Phil
What
shouted Ford
You'll have to remind me, said Zaphod
I've a terrible memory for species
It was at a party, pursued Arthur
Yeah, well I doubt that, said Zaphod
Cool it will you Arthur
demanded Ford
Arthur would not be deterred
A party six months ago
On Earth
England
Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile
London, insisted Arthur, Islington
Oh, said Zaphod with a guilty start, that party
This wasn't fair on Ford at all
He looked backwards and forwards between Arthur and Zaphod
What
he said to Zaphod
You don't mean to say you've been on that miserable planet as well do you
No, of course not, said Zaphod breezily
Well, I may have just dropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere
But I was stuck there for fifteen years
Well I didn't know that did I
But what were you doing there
Looking about, you know
He gatecrashed a party, persisted Arthur, trembling with anger, a fancy dress party
It would have to be, wouldn't it
said Ford
At this party, persisted Arthur, was a girl
oh well, look it doesn't matter now
The whole place has gone up in smoke anyway
I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet, said Ford
Who was the lady
Oh just somebody
Well alright, I wasn't doing very well with her
I'd been trying all evening
Hell, she was something though
Beautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I'd got her to myself for a bit and was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours barges up and says Hey doll, is this guy boring you
Why don't you talk to me instead
I'm from a different planet
I never saw her again
Zaphod
exclaimed Ford
Yes, said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish
He only had the two arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, but
But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet, said Trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge
She gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the ship's controls again
There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled mess of Arthur's brain crawled some words
Tricia McMillian
he said
What are you doing here
Same as you, she said, I hitched a lift
After all with a degree in Maths and another in astrophysics what else was there to do
It was either that or the dole queue again on Monday
Infinity minus one, chattered the computer, Improbability sum now complete
Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian
Trillian, he said, is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the Improbability drive
Very probably, I'm afraid, she said
The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive
Its crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle of physics — as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules
As the ship's artificial night closed in they were each grateful to retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts
Trillian couldn't sleep
She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage which contained her last and only links with Earth — two white mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring
She had expected not to see the planet again, but she was disturbed by her negative reaction to the planet's destruction
It seemed remote and unreal and she could find no thoughts to think about it
She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention
Suddenly she shook herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures that charted the ship's progress through the void
She wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think about
Zaphod couldn't sleep
He also wished he knew what it was that he wouldn't let himself think about
For as long as he could remember he'd suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there
Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside and not worry about it, but it had been re-awakened by the sudden inexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent
Somehow it seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn't see
Ford couldn't sleep
He was too excited about being back on the road again
Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he was finally beginning to give up hope
Knocking about with Zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed to be something faintly odd about his semi-cousin that he couldn't put his finger on
The fact that he had become President of the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post
Was there a reason behind it
There would be no point in asking Zaphod, he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had turned unfathomably into an art form
He attacked everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which
Arthur slept: he was terribly tired
There was a tap at Zaphod's door
It slid open
Zaphod
Yeah
I think we just found what you came to look for
Hey, yeah
Ford gave up the attempt to sleep
In the corner of his cabin was a small computer screen and keyboard
He sat at it for a while and tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject of Vogons but couldn't think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to the bridge
As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched excitedly over the instruments
See
The ship's about to move into orbit, Trillian was saying
There's a planet out there
It's at the exact coordinates you predicted
Zaphod heard a noise and looked up
Ford
he hissed
Hey, come and take a look at this
Ford went and had a look at it
It was a series of figures flashing over a screen
You recognize those Galactic coordinates
said Zaphod
No
I'll give you a clue
Computer
Hi gang
enthused the computer
This is getting real sociable isn't it
Shut up, said Zaphod, and show up the screens
Light on the bridge sank
Pinpoints of light played across the consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor screens
There was absolutely nothing on them
Recognize that
whispered Zaphod
Ford frowned
Er, no, he said
What do you see
Nothing
Recognize it
What are you talking about
We're in the Horsehead Nebula
One whole vast dark cloud
And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen
Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you'd see a dark screen
Very good
Zaphod laughed
He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so
Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much
What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud
said Ford
What would you reckon to find here
urged Zaphod
Nothing
No stars
No planets
No
Computer
shouted Zaphod, rotate angle of vision through one-eighty degrees and don't talk about it
For a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen
A red star the size of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another one — a binary system
Then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of the picture — a red glare shading away into the deep black, the night side of the planet
I've found it
cried Zaphod, thumping the console
I've found it
Ford stared at it in astonishment
What is it
he said
That
said Zaphod, is the most improbable planet that ever existed
Excerpt from The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Page 634784, Section 5a, Entry: Magrathea) Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free
Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space
In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri
And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before — and thus was the Empire forged
Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor — at least no one worth speaking of
And for all the richest and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the worlds they'd settled on — none of them was entirely satisfactory: either the climate wasn't quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink
And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry: custom-made luxury planet building
The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets — gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes — all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the Galaxy's richest men naturally came to expect
But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject poverty
And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the value of a planned political economy
Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscurity of legend
In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it
Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge
Ford was waving his arms about
You're crazy, Zaphod, he was saying, Magrathea is a myth, a fairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to become economists, it's
And that's what we are currently in orbit around, insisted Zaphod
Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around, said Ford, but this ship
Computer
shouted Zaphod
Oh no
Hi there
This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling just great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any programme you care to run through me
Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian
She motioned him to come on in but keep quiet
Computer, said Zaphod, tell us again what our present trajectory is
A real pleasure feller, it burbled, we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of Magrathea
Proving nothing, said Ford
I wouldn't trust that computer to speak my weight
I can do that for you, sure, enthused the computer, punching out more tickertape
I can even work out you personality problems to ten decimal places if it will help
Trillian interrupted
Zaphod, she said, any minute now we will be swinging round to the daylight side of this planet, adding, whatever it turns out to be
Hey, what do you mean by that
The planet's where I predicted it would be isn't it
Yes, I know there's a planet there
I'm not arguing with anyone, it's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea from any other lump of cold rock
Dawn's coming up if you want it
OK, OK, muttered Zaphod, let's at least give our eyes a good time
Computer
Hi there
What can I
Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again
A dark featureless mass once more filled the screens — the planet rolling away beneath them
They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety with excitement
We are now traversing the night side
he said in a hushed voice
The planet rolled on
The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us
he continued
He was trying to restore a sense of occasion to what he felt should have been a great moment
Magrathea
He was piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction
Magrathea
In a few seconds, he continued, we should see
there
The moment carried itself
Even the most seasoned star tramp can't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the Galaxy
Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light
It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire
Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them
The fires of dawn

breathed Zaphod
The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm

Or whatever, said Ford quietly
Soulianis and Rahm
insisted Zaphod
The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans so much
As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was
It faintly irritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work for him
All this Magrathea nonsense seemed juvenile
Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too
All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to Arthur
He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on
I only know what Zaphod's told me, she whispered
Apparently Magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes in
Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that the legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets
Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important
Suddenly he realized what it was
Is there any tea on this spaceship
he asked
More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of Gold streaked along its orbital path
The suns now stood high in the black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day — grey, dusty and only dimly contoured
It looked dead and cold as a crypt
From time to time promising features would appear on the distant horizon — ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities — but as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire
The planet's surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century
Clearly, it was very very old
A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape move beneath them
The immensity of time worried him, he could feel it as a presence
He cleared his throat
Well, even supposing it is
It is, said Zaphod
Which it isn't, continued Ford
What do you want with it anyway
There's nothing there
Not on the surface, said Zaphod
Alright, just supposing there's something
I take it you're not here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all
What are you after
One of Zaphod's heads looked away
The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at anything very much
Well, said Zaphod airily, it's partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's the fame and the money
Ford glanced at him sharply
He got a very strong impression that Zaphod hadn't the faintest idea why he was there at all
You know I don't like the look of that planet at all, said Trillian shivering
Ah, take no notice, said Zaphod, with half the wealth of the former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to look frumpy
Bullshit, thought Ford
Even supposing this was the home of some ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now
He shrugged
I think it's just a dead planet, he said
The suspense is killing me, said Arthur testily
Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not in any way be exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance
The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea
The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a micecage, the bruising of somebody's upper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale
In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained the bruise
This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no significance whatsoever
After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was beginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left him with
He had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea
The way it functioned was very interesting
When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject's brain to see what was likely to go down well
However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea
The Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers all the major land masses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system
Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving
He glanced up at the screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past
It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him
Is it safe
he said
Magrathea's been dead for five million years, said Zaphod, of course it's safe
Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now
At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge — a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound
It preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial
The voice said Greetings to you
Someone from the dead planet was talking to them
Computer
shouted Zaphod
Hi there
What the photon is it
Oh, just some five-million-year-old tape that's being broadcast at us
A what
A recording
Shush
said Ford
It's carrying on
The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with quite unmistakable menace
This is a recorded announcement, it said, as I'm afraid we're all out at the moment
The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit
A voice from ancient Magrathea
shouted Zaphod
OK, OK, said Ford

but regrets, continued the voice, that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business
Thank you
If you would care to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone
A short buzz followed, then silence
They want to get rid of us, said Trillian nervously
What do we do
It's just a recording, said Zaphod
We keep going
Got that, computer
I got it, said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed
They waited
After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice
We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to select from all that's best in contemporary geography
The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge
Meanwhile we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave
Now
Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions
Well, I suppose we'd better be going then, hadn't we
he suggested
Shhh
said Zaphod
There's absolutely nothing to be worried about
Then why's everyone so tense
They're just interested
shouted Zaphod
Computer, start a descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing
This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly cold
It is most gratifying, it said, that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail
We look forward to your custom in future lives
thank you
The voice snapped off
Oh, said Trillian
Er
said Arthur
Well
said Ford
Look, said Zaphod, will you get it into your heads
That's just a recorded message
It's millions of years old
It doesn't apply to us, get it
What, said Trillian quietly, about the missiles
Missiles
Don't make me laugh
Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen
Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship
A quick change of magnification brought them into close focus - two massively real rockets thundering through the sky
The suddenness of it was shocking
I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to us, said Ford
Zaphod stared at them in astonishment
Hey this is terrific
he said
Someone down there is trying to kill us
Terrific, said Arthur
But don't you see what this means
Yes
We're going to die
Yes, but apart from that
Apart from that
It means we must be on to something
How soon can we get off it
Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became larger
They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head on
As a matter of interest, said Trillian, what are we going to do
Just keep cool, said Zaphod
Is that all
shouted Arthur
No, we're also going to
er
take evasive action
said Zaphod with a sudden access of panic
Computer, what evasive action can we take
Er, none I'm afraid, guys, said the computer
or something, said Zaphod,
er
he said
There seems to be something jamming my guidance system, explained the computer brightly, impact minus forty-five seconds
Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax
Zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions simultaneously
Right
he said
Er
we've got to get manual control of this ship
Can you fly her
asked Ford pleasantly
No, can you
No
Trillian, can you
No
Fine, said Zaphod, relaxing
We'll do it together
I can't either, said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert himself
I'd guessed that, said Zaphod
OK computer, I want full manual control now
You got it, said the computer
Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-up cellophane: these controls had never been used before
Zaphod stared at them wildly
OK, Ford, he said, full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard
Or something
Good luck guys, chirped the computer, impact minus thirty seconds
Ford leapt to the controls — only a few of them made any immediate sense to him so he pulled those
The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously
He released half of them and the ship span round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the oncoming missiles
Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against them
For a few seconds the inertial forces held them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move
Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system
The lever snapped off
The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards
The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin
Ford's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone
It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm
This should be emphasized because, as had already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship
The safety of the crew is absolutely assured
Impact minus twenty seconds, guys
said the computer
Then turn the bloody engines back on
bawled Zaphod
OK, sure thing, guys, said the computer
With a subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again
The computer started to sing
When you walk through the storm
it whined nasally, hold your head up high
Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction
And don't
be afraid
of the dark
Eddie wailed
The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems
At the end of the storm
crooned Eddie
The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship
is a golden sky
But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it
And the sweet silver songs of the lark
Revised impact time fifteen seconds fellas
Walk on through the wind
The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back into pursuit
This is it, said Arthur watching them
We are now quite definitely going to die aren't we
I wish you'd stop saying that, shouted Ford
Well we are aren't we
Yes
Walk on through the rain
sang Eddie
A thought struck Arthur
He struggled to his feet
Why doesn't anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing
he said
We could probably reach that
What are you crazy
said Zaphod
Without proper programming anything could happen
Does that matter at this stage
shouted Arthur
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
sand Eddie
Arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces of moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the Improbability Drive
shouted Trillian
And you'll never walk alone
Impact minus five seconds, it's been great knowing you guys, God bless
You'll ne
ver
walk
alone
I said, yelled Trillian, does anyone know
The next thing that happened was a mid-mangling explosion of noise and light
And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior
It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue
In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal
Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden
Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs
As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your hands
Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the required data readouts, though it was far from clear where they were reflected from
It was in fact sensationally beautiful
Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, What the hell happened
Well I was just saying, said Arthur lounging by a small fish pool, there's this Improbability   Drive switch over here
he waved at where it had been
There was a potted plant there now
But where are we
said Ford who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand
Exactly where we were, I think
said Trillian, as all about them the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape of Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them
Zaphod leapt out of his seat
Then what's happened to the missiles
he said
A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors
They would appear, said Ford doubtfully, to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale
At an Improbability Factor, cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed a bit, of eight million seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand one hundred and twenty-eight to one against
Zaphod stared at Arthur
Did you think of that, Earthman
he demanded
Well, said Arthur, all I did was
That's very good thinking you know
Turn on the Improbability Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens
Hey kid you just saved our lives, you know that
Oh, said Arthur, well, it was nothing really
Was it
said Zaphod
Oh well, forget it then
OK, computer, take us in to land
But
I said forget it
Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet
And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more
This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it
Ah

What's happening
it thought
Er, excuse me, who am I
Hello
Why am I here
What's my purpose in life
What do I mean by who am I
Calm down, get a grip now
oh
this is an interesting sensation, what is it
It's a sort of
yawning, tingling sensation in my
my
well I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach
Good
Ooooh, it's getting quite strong
And hey, what's about this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head
Perhaps I can call that
wind
Is that a good name
It'll do
perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I've found out what it's for
It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it
Hey
What's this thing
This
let's call it a tail — yeah, tail
Hey
I can can really thrash it about pretty good can't I
Wow
Wow
That feels great
Doesn't seem to achieve very much but I'll probably find out what it's for later on
Now - have I built up any coherent picture of things yet
No
Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation
Or is it the wind
There really is a lot of that now isn't it
And wow
Hey
What's this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast
Very very fast
So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like
ow
ound
round
ground
That's it
That's a good name — ground
I wonder if it will be friends with me
And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence
Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again
Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now
Are we taking this robot with us
said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree
Zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of Gold had now landed
Oh, the Paranoid Android, he said
Yeah, we'll take him
But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot
You think you've got problems, said Marvin as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin, what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot
No, don't bother to answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer
It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level
Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin
My white mice have escaped
she said
An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod's faces
Nuts to your white mice, he said
Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again
It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realized that human beings were only the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) the second
Good afternoon boys
The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly different
It had a matriarchal twang
It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the planet surface
They looked at each other in puzzlement
It's the computer, explained Zaphod
I discovered it had an emergency back-up personality that I thought might work out better
Now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new planet, continued Eddie's new voice, so I want you all wrapped up snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed monsters
Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch
I'm sorry, he said, I think we might be better off with a slide rule
Right
snapped the computer
Who said that
Will you open the exit hatch please, computer
said Zaphod trying not to get angry
Not until whoever said that owns up, urged the computer, stamping a few synapses closed
Oh God, muttered Ford, slumped against a bulkhead and started to count to ten
He was desperately worried that one day sentinent life forms would forget how to do this
Only by counting could humans demonstrate their independence of computers
Come on, said Eddie sternly
Computer
began Zaphod
I'm waiting, interrupted Eddie
I can wait all day if necessary
Computer
said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground, if you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe, got that
Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this
Ford carried on counting quietly
This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying Blood
blood
blood
blood
Finally Eddie said quietly, I can see this relationship is something we're all going to have to work at, and the hatchway opened
An icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and stepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of Magrathea
It'll all end in tears, I know it, shouted Eddie after them and closed the hatchway again
A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again in response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise
Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land
Bits of it were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at
It was like a dried-out marsh, now barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick
It was very cold
Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it
He stalked off by himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground
The wind stung Arthur's eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his throat
However, the thing stung most was his mind
It's fantastic
he said, and his own voice rattled his ears
Sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere
Desolate hole if you ask me, said Ford
I could have more fun in a cat litter
He felt a mounting irritation
Of all the planets in all the star systems of all the Galaxy — didn't he just have to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway
Not even a hot dog stand in evidence
He stooped down and picked up a cold clot of earth, but there was nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of light years to look at
No, insisted Arthur, don't you understand, this is the first time I've actually stood on the surface of another planet
a whole alien world
Pity it's such a dump though
Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned
She could have sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them
She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join him
He seemed to be excited, but they couldn't clearly hear what he was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind
As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it seemed to be circular — a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide
Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was spattered with black and red lumps
They stopped and looked at a piece
It was wet
It was rubbery
With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat
At the top of the crater's lip they met Zaphod
Look, he said, pointing into the crater
In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot
The silence was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian's throat
I suppose there's no point in trying to bury it
murmured Arthur, and then wished he hadn't
Come, said Zaphod and started back down into the crater
What, down there
said Trillian with severe distaste
Yeah, said Zaphod, come on, I've got something to show you
We can see it, said Trillian
Not that, said Zaphod, something else
Come on
They all hesitated
Come on, insisted Zaphod, I've found a way in
In
said Arthur in horror
Into the interior of the planet
An underground passage
The force of the whale's impact cracked it open, and that's where we have to go
Where no man has trod these five million years, into the very depths of time itself
Marvin started his ironical humming again
Zaphod hit him and he shut up
With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the incline into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate creator
Life, said Marvin dolefully, loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it
The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails
Zaphod had made a start clearing a way into one of them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster
Dank air wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod shone a torch into it, little was visible in the dusty gloom
According to the legends, he said, the Magratheans lived most of their lives underground
Why's that
said Arthur
Did the surface become too polluted or overpopulated
No, I don't think so, said Zaphod
I think they just didn't like it very much
Are you sure you know what you're doing
said Trillian peering nervously into the darkness
We've been attacked once already you know
Look kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus the four of us, so come on, let's get on in there
Er, hey Earthman
Arthur, said Arthur
Yeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of the passageway
OK
Guard
said Arthur
What from
You just said there's no one here
Yeah, well, just for safety, OK
said Zaphod
Whose
Yours or mine
Good lad
OK, here we go
Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and Ford
Well I hope you all have a really miserable time, complained Arthur
Don't worry, Marvin assured him, they will
In a few seconds they had disappeared from view
Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale's graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in
Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself off
Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying to hide it by striding purposefully
He flung the torch beam around
The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the touch, the air thick with decay
There, what did I tell you
he said
An inhabited planet
Magrathea, and he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile floor
Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid
At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics — simple angular patterns in bright colours
Trillian stopped and studied one of them but could not interpret any sense in them
She called to Zaphod
Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are
I think they're just strange symbols of some kind, said Zaphod, hardly glancing back
Trillian shrugged and hurried after him
From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment
He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look
Trillian followed
Look, said Ford, you reckon this is Magrathea
Yeah, said Zaphod, and we heard the voice, right
OK, so I've bought the fact that it's Magrathea — for the moment
What you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you found it
You didn't just look it up in a star atlas, that's for sure
Research
Government archives
Detective work
Few lucky guesses
Easy
And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with
I stole it to look for a lot of things
A lot of things
said Ford in surprise
Like what
I don't know
What
I don't know what I'm looking for
Why not
Because
because
I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn't be able to look for them
What, are you crazy
It's a possibility I haven't ruled out yet, said Zaphod quietly
I only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions
And its current conditions are not good
For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind suddenly full of worry
Listen old friend, if you want to
started Ford eventually
No, wait
I'll tell you something, said Zaphod
I freewheel a lot
I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it
I reckon I'll become President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it's easy
I decide to steal this ship
I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens
Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always works out
It's like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send off the cheques
And then whenever I stop and think — why did I want to do something
how did I work out how to do it
I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it
Like I have now
It's a big effort to talk about it
Zaphod paused for a while
For a while there was silence
Then he frowned and said, Last night I was worrying about this again
About the fact that part of my mind just didn't seem to work properly
Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it
I put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I couldn't use it
I wondered if there was a way I could check
I went to the ship's medical bay and plugged myself into the encephelographic screen
I went through every major screening test on both my heads — all the tests I had to go through under government medical officers before my nomination for Presidency could be properly ratified
They showed up nothing
Nothing unexpected at least
They showed that I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn't have guessed
And no other anomalies
So I started inventing further tests, completely at random
Nothing
Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the results from the other head
Still nothing
Finally I got silly, because I'd given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia
Last thing I did before I packed it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter
You remember I was always superstitious about the color green when I was a kid
I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts
Ford nodded
And there it was, said Zaphod, clear as day
A whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else around them
Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically traumatised those two lumps of cerebellum
Ford stared at him, aghast
Trillian had turned white
Somebody did that to you
whispered Ford
Yeah
But have you any idea who
Or why
Why
I can only guess
But I do know who the bastard was
You know
How do you know
Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses
They left them there for me to see
Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl
Initials
Burnt into your brain
Yeah
Well, what were they, for God's sake
Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment
Then he looked away
Z
B
he said
At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas started to pour into the chamber
I'll tell you about it later, choked Zaphod as all three passed out
On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily
Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy to while away the time with
He pushed a few buttons at random
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the time
One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened to all the biros he'd bought over the past few years
There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time
Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms
And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life
And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public
When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying
There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand biro business
Arthur read this, and put the book down
The robot still sat there, completely inert
Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater
He walked around the crater
He watched two suns set magnificently over Magrathea
He went back down into the crater
He woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody
Night's falling, he said
Look robot, the stars are coming out
From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen
The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back
I know, he said
Wretched isn't it
But that sunset
I've never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams
the two suns
It was like mountains of fire boiling into space
I've seen it, said Marvin
It's rubbish
We only ever had the one sun at home, persevered Arthur, I came from a planet called Earth you know
I know, said Marvin, you keep going on about it
It sounds awful
Ah no, it was a beautiful place
Did it have oceans
Oh yes, said Arthur with a sigh, great wide rolling blue oceans
Can't bear oceans, said Marvin
Tell me, inquired Arthur, do you get on well with other robots
Hate them, said Marvin
Where are you going
Arthur couldn't bear any more
He had got up again
I think I'll just take another walk, he said
Don't blame you, said Marvin and counted five hundred and ninety-seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later
Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job
He trudged back up the wall of the crater
Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark
Because of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed him
He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon
He was tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe
When he turned his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with
But he didn't turn yet, not even to react to Arthur's yelp of surprise
Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned
His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some kind — a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed
It shed a dim pool of light around it
The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed
You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet, he said
Who
who are you
stammered Arthur
The man looked away
Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his face
My name is not important, he said
He seemed to have something on his mind
Conversation was clearly something he felt he didn't have to rush at
Arthur felt awkward
I
er
you startled me
he said, lamely
The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows
Hmmmm
he said
I said you startled me
Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you
Arthur frowned at him
But you shot at us
There were missiles
he said
The man chuckled slightly
An automatic system, he said and gave a small sigh
Ancient computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks
I think they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony
He looked gravely at Arthur and said, I'm a great fan of science you know
Oh
er, really
said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man's curious, kindly manner disconcerting
Oh, yes, said the old man, and simply stopped talking again
Ah, said Arthur, er
He had an odd felling of being like a man in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman's husband wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and leaves again
You seem ill at ease, said the old man with polite concern
Er, no
well, yes
Actually you see, we weren't really expecting to find anybody about in fact
I sort of gathered that you were all dead or something
Dead
said the old man
Good gracious no, we have but slept
Slept
said Arthur incredulously
Yes, through the economic recession you see, said the old man, apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he was talking about or not
Er, economic recession
Well you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-made planets are something of a luxury commodity you see
He paused and looked at Arthur
You know we built planets do you
he asked solemnly
Well yes, said Arthur, I'd sort of gathered
Fascinating trade, said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, doing the coastlines was always my favourite
Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords
so anyway, he said trying to find his thread again, the recession came and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if we just slept through it
So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over
The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued
The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market prices you see, so that we'd all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services
Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this
That's a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn't it
Is it
asked the old man mildly
I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of touch
He pointed down into the crater
Is that robot yours
he said
No, came a thin metallic voice from the crater, I'm mine
If you'd call it a robot, muttered Arthur
It's more a sort of electronic sulking machine
Bring it, said the old man
Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision suddenly present in the old man's voice
He called to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn't
On second thoughts, said the old man, leave it here
You must come with me
Great things are afoot
He turned towards his craft which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through the dark
Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater again muttering sour nothings to himself
Come, called the old man, come now or you will be late
Late
said Arthur
What for
What is your name, human
Dent
Arthur Dent, said Arthur
Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent, said the old man, sternly
It's a sort of threat you see
Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes
I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can be very effective
Arthur blinked at him
What an extraordinary person, he muttered to himself
I beg your pardon
said the old man
Oh nothing, I'm sorry, said Arthur in embarrassment
Alright, where do we go
In my aircar, said the old man motioning Arthur to get into the craft which had settled silently next to them
We are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its five-million-year slumber
Magrathea awakes
Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man
The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled him
He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel
Excuse me, he said to him, what is your name by the way
My name
said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again
He paused
My name, he said,
is Slartibartfast
Arthur practically choked
I beg your pardon
he spluttered
Slartibartfast, repeated the old man quietly
Slartibartfast
The old man looked at him gravely
I said it wasn't important, he said
The aircar sailed through the night
It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem
For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much — the wheel, New York, wars and so on — whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time
But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man — for precisely the same reasons
Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the Star Sprangled Banner, but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish
In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man
The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these creatures' plans
Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night
It sped swiftly
Arthur's companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that
Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points
The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all
Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be
He peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be a collision course
Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over
The next thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him
He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realize what had happened
They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground
The colossal speed had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel
The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour
He closed his eyes in terror
After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt
He opened his eyes again
They were still in the silver tunnel, threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of converging tunnels
When they finally stopped it was in a small chamber of curved steel
Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating light
It was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far it was
Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it might be ultra violet
Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes
Earthman, he said, we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea
How did you know I was an Earthman
demanded Arthur
These things will become clear to you, said the old man gently, at least, he added with slight doubt in his voice, clearer than they are at the moment
He continued: I should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not literally exist within our planet
It is a little too
large
We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace
It may disturb you
Arthur made nervous noises
Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly
It scares the willies out of me
Hold tight
The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like
It wasn't infinity in fact
Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting
Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity — distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless
The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very very big, so that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself
Arthur's senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them
The wall
The wall defied the imagination — seduced it and defeated it
The wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond the reach of sight
The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man
The wall appeared perfectly flat
It would take the finest laser measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved
It met itself again thirteen light seconds away
In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light
Welcome, said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space, welcome, he said, to our factory floor
Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror
Ranged away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space
This, said Slartibartfast, is where we make most of our planets you see
You mean, said Arthur, trying to form the words, you mean you're starting it all up again now
No no, good heavens no, exclaimed the old man, no, the Galaxy isn't nearly rich enough to support us yet
No, we've been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very
special clients from another dimension
It may interest you
there in the distance in front of us
Arthur followed the old man's finger, till he was able to pick out the floating structure he was pointing out
It was indeed the only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was more a sublimal impression than anything one could put one's finger on
At the moment however a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within
Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind
For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense
Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction
The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt
The Earth
whispered Arthur
Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact, said Slartibartfast cheerfully
We're making a copy from our original blueprints
There was a pause
Are you trying to tell me, said Arthur, slowly and with control, that you originally
made the Earth
Oh yes, said Slartibartfast
Did you ever go to a place
I think it was called Norway
No, said Arthur, no, I didn't
Pity, said Slartibartfast, that was one of mine
Won an award you know
Lovely crinkly edges
I was most upset to hear about its destruction
You were upset
Yes
Five minutes later and it wouldn't have mattered so much
It was a quite shocking cock-up
Huh
said Arthur
The mice were furious
The mice were furious
Oh yes, said the old man mildly
Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses, but
Ah, but they hadn't paid for it you see, had they
Look, said Arthur, would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now
For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence
Then the old man tried patiently to explain
Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice
It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got to build another one
Only one word registered with Arthur
Mice
he said
Indeed Earthman
Look, sorry — are we talking about the little white furry things with the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit coms
Slartibartfast coughed politely
Earthman, he said, it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech
Remember I have been asleep inside this planet of Magrathea for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak
These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear
They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings
The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front
The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued
They've been experimenting on you I'm afraid
Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared
Ah no, he said, I see the source of the misunderstanding now
No, look you see, what happened was that we used to do experiments on them
They were often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuff
So what happened was hat the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run around mazes and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be examined
From our observations of their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about our own
Arthur's voice tailed off
Such subtlety
said Slartibartfast, one has to admire it
What
said Arthur
How better to disguise their real natures, and how better to guide your thinking
Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis, — if it's finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous
He paused for effect
You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings
Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten-million-year research programme
Let me tell you the whole story
It'll take a little time
Time, said Arthur weakly, is not currently one of my problems
There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are Why are people born
Why do they die
Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches
Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan-dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all
And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off
It was the size of a small city
Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest ultramahagony topped with rich ultrared leather
The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square
On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed programmers with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office
They were aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the desk, opened their brief cases and took out their leather-bound notebooks
Their names were Lunkwill and Fook
For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black panel
The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total active mode
After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep
It said: What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space have been called into existence
Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise
Your task, O Computer
began Fook
No, wait a minute, this isn't right, said Lunkwill, worried
We distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and we're not making do with second best
Deep Thought, he addressed the computer, are you not as we designed you to be, the greatest most powerful computer in all time
I described myself as the second greatest, intoned Deep Thought, and such I am
Another worried look passed between the two programmers
Lunkwill cleared his throat
There must be some mistake, he said, are you not a greatest computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond
The Milliard Gargantubrain
said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt
A mere abacus — mention it not
And are you not, said Fook leaning anxiously forward, a greater analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard
A five-week sand blizzard
said Deep Thought haughtily
You ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself
Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff
The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment
Then Lunkwill leaned forward again
But are you not, he said, a more fiendish disputant than the Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, the Magic and Indefatigable
The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler, said Deep Thought thoroughly rolling the r's, could talk all four legs off an Arcturan MegaDonkey — but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards
Then what, asked Fook, is the problem
There is no problem, said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing tones
I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time
But the second
insisted Lunkwill
Why do you keep saying the second
You're surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller are you
Or the Pondermatic
Or the
Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer's console
I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons
he boomed
I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me
Fook was losing patience
He pushed his notebook aside and muttered, I think this is getting needlessly messianic
You know nothing of future time, pronounced Deep Thought, and yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta streams of future probability and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually to design
Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill
Can we get on and ask the question
he said
Lunkwill motioned him to wait
What computer is this of which you speak
he asked
I will speak of it no further in this present time, said Deep Thought
Now
Ask what else of me you will that I may function
Speak
They shrugged at each other
Fook composed himself
O Deep Thought Computer, he said, the task we have designed you to perform is this
We want you to tell us
he paused,
the Answer
The answer
said Deep Thought
The answer to what
Life
urged Fook
The Universe
said Lunkwill
Everything
they said in chorus
Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection
Tricky, he said finally
But can you do it
Again, a significant pause
Yes, said Deep Thought, I can do it
There is an answer
said Fook with breathless excitement
A simple answer
added Lunkwill
Yes, said Deep Thought
Life, the Universe, and Everything
There is an answer
But, he added, I'll have to think about it
A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew open and two angry men wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way
We demand admission
shouted the younger of the two men elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat
Come on, shouted the older one, you can't keep us out
He pushed a junior programmer back through the door
We demand that you can't keep us out
bawled the younger one, though he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made to stop him
Who are you
said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat
What do you want
I am Majikthise
announced the older one
And I demand that I am Vroomfondel
shouted the younger one
Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel
It's alright, he explained angrily, you don't need to demand that
Alright
bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk
I am Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact
What we demand is solid facts
No we don't
exclaimed Majikthise in irritation
That is precisely what we don't demand
Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, We don't demand solid facts
What we demand is a total absence of solid facts
I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel
But who the devil are you
exclaimed an outraged Fook
We, said Majikthise, are Philosophers
Though we may not be, said Vroomfondel waving a warning finger at the programmers
Yes we are, insisted Majikthise
We are quite definitely here as representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and we want this machine off, and we want it off now
What's the problem
said Lunkwill
I'll tell you what the problem is mate, said Majikthise, demarcation, that's the problem
We demand, yelled Vroomfondel, that demarcation may or may not be the problem
You just let the machines get on with the adding up, warned Majikthise, and we'll take care of the eternal verities thank you very much
You want to check your legal position you do mate
Under law the Quest for Ultimate Truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers
Any bloody machine goes and actually finds it and we're straight out of a job aren't we
I mean what's the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives us his bleeding phone number the next morning
That's right
shouted Vroomfondel, we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty
Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room
Might I make an observation at this point
inquired Deep Thought
We'll go on strike
yelled Vroomfondel
That's right
agreed Majikthise
You'll have a national Philosopher's strike on your hands
The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass driver units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give Deep Thought's voice a little more power
All I wanted to say, bellowed the computer, is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything - he paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone's attention, before continuing more quietly, but the programme will take me a little while to run
Fook glanced impatiently at his watch
How long
he said
Seven and a half million years, said Deep Thought
Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other
Seven and a half million years
they cried in chorus
Yes, declaimed Deep Thought, I said I'd have to think about it, didn't I
And it occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in general
Everyone's going to have their own theories about what answer I'm eventually to come up with, and who better to capitalize on that media market than you yourself
So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular press, you can keep yourself on the gravy train for life
How does that sound
The two philosophers gaped at him
Bloody hell, said Majikthise, now that is what I call thinking
Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that
Dunno, said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, think our brains must be too highly trained Majikthise
So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams
Yes, very salutary, said Arthur, after Slartibartfast had related the salient points of the story to him, but I don't understand what all this has got to do with the Earth and mice and things
That is but the first half of the story Earthman, said the old man
If you would care to discover what happened seven and a half millions later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me to invite you to my study where you can experience the events yourself on our Sens-O-Tape records
That is unless you would care to take a quick stroll on the surface of New Earth
It's only half completed I'm afraid — we haven't even finished burying the artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet, then we have the Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era to lay down, and
No thank you, said Arthur, it wouldn't be quite the same
No, said Slartibartfast, it won't be, and he turned the aircar round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall
Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public library
The old man frowned as they stepped in
Terribly unfortunate, he said, a diode blew in one of the life-support computers
When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered they'd been dead for nearly thirty thousand years
Who's going to clear away the bodies, that's what I want to know
Look why don't you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in
He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus
It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus, explained the old man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments
Here, he said, hold these, and passed a couple of stripped wire end to Arthur
The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him
He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself
Beneath him was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse for wear — many were cracked and stained with rain
Today however the sun was shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited people
Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air
Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time to reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and called for everyone's attention
A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a Tannoy
O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought
he cried out
Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known
The Time of Waiting is over
Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd
Flags, streamers and wolf whistles sailed through the air
The narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air
Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and Hopefully Enlightening Day
cried the cheer leader
The Day of the Answer
Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd
Never again, cried the man, never again will we wake up in the morning and think Who am I
What is my purpose in life
Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work
For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and Everything
As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd
He experienced a moment's panic as he sailed straight through towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently touching it
No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly surprising as he wasn't there
He began to realize that the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat
The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it
In seven and a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century or so
The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk's leather top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday
Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited
The time is nearly upon us, said one, and Arthur was surprised to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's neck
The word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple of times and the disappeared again
Before Arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word Phouchg appeared by his neck
Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in motion, the second man said, and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak
An awesome prospect, Phouchg, agreed the first man, and Arthur suddenly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles
We are the ones who will hear, said Phouchg, the answer to the great question of Life
The Universe
said Loonquawl
And Everything
Shhh, said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak
There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on the front of the console
Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern
A soft low hum came from the communication channel
Good morning, said Deep Thought at last
Er
Good morning, O Deep Thought, said Loonquawl nervously, do you have
er, that is
An answer for you
interrupted Deep Thought majestically
Yes
I have
The two men shivered with expectancy
Their waiting had not been in vain
There really is one
breathed Phouchg
There really is one, confirmed Deep Thought
To Everything
To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything
Yes
Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children
And you're ready to give it to us
urged Loonquawl
I am
Now
Now, said Deep Thought
They both licked their dry lips
Though I don't think, added Deep Thought, that you're going to like it
Doesn't matter
said Phouchg
We must know it
Now
Now
inquired Deep Thought
Yes
Now
Alright, said the computer and settled into silence again
The two men fidgeted
The tension was unbearable
You're really not going to like it, observed Deep Thought
Tell us
Alright, said Deep Thought
The Answer to the Great Question
Yes
Of Life, the Universe and Everything
said Deep Thought
Yes
Is
said Deep Thought, and paused
Yes
Is
Yes
Forty-two, said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm
It was a long time before anyone spoke
Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of tense expectant faces down in the square outside
We're going to get lynched aren't we
he whispered
It was a tough assignment, said Deep Thought mildly
Forty-two
yelled Loonquawl
Is that all you've got to show for seven and a half million years' work
I checked it very thoroughly, said the computer, and that quite definitely is the answer
I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is
But it was the Great Question
The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything
howled Loonquawl
Yes, said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, but what actually is it
A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other
Well, you know, it's just Everything
Everything
offered Phouchg weakly
Exactly
said Deep Thought
So once you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means
Oh terrific, muttered Phouchg flinging aside his notebook and wiping away a tiny tear
Look, alright, alright, said Loonquawl, can you just please tell us the Question
The Ultimate Question
Yes
Of Life, the Universe, and Everything
Yes
Deep Thought pondered this for a moment
Tricky, he said
But can you do it
cried Loonquawl
Deep Thought pondered this for another long moment
Finally: No, he said firmly
Both men collapsed on to their chairs in despair
But I'll tell you who can, said Deep Thought
They both looked up sharply
Who
Tell us
Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp begin to crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably forward towards the console, but it was only a dramatic zoom on the part of whoever had made the recording he assumed
I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me, intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones
A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate — and yet I will design it for you
A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix
And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year program
Yes
I shall design this computer for you
And I shall name it also unto you
And it shall be called
The Earth
Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought
What a dull name, he said and great incisions appeared down the length of his body
Loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrific gashed from nowhere
The Computer console blotched and cracked, the walls flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upwards into its own ceiling
Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur holding the two wires
End of the tape, he explained
Zaphod
Wake up
Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr
Hey come on, wake up
Just let me stick to what I'm good at, yeah
muttered Zaphod and rolled away from the voice back to sleep
Do you want me to kick you
said Ford
Would it give you a lot of pleasure
said Zaphod, blearily
No
Nor me
So what's the point
Stop bugging me
Zaphod curled himself up
He got a double dose of the gas, said Trillian looking down at him, two windpipes
And stop talking, said Zaphod, it's hard enough trying to sleep anyway
What's the matter with the ground
It's all cold and hard
It's gold, said Ford
With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and scanning the horizon, because that was how far the gold ground stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth and solid
It gleamed like
it's impossible to say what it gleamed like because nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet of solid gold does
Who put all that there
yelped Zaphod, goggle-eyed
Don't get excited, said Ford, it's only a catalogue
A who
A catalogue, said Trillian, an illusion
How can you say that
cried Zaphod, falling to his hands and knees and staring at the ground
He poked it and prodded it with his fingernail
It was very heavy and very slightly soft — he could mark it with his fingernail
It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold
Trillian and I came round a while ago, said Ford
We shouted and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us
This is all Sens-O-Tape
Zaphod stared at him bitterly
Ah, shit, he said, you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream to show me somebody else's
He sat down in a huff
What's that series of valleys over there
he said
Hallmark, said Ford
We had a look
We didn't wake you earlier, said Trillian
The last planet was knee deep in fish
Fish
Some people like the oddest things
And before that, said Ford, we had platinum
Bit dull
We thought you'd like to see this one though
Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked
Very pretty, said Zaphod petulantly
In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared
It flickered and changed, and when they looked around again so had the land
As with one voice they all went, Yuch
The sea was purple
The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green pebbles — presumably terribly precious stones
The mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks
Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassles
In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number
It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you
We are not proud
And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes
In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime meadow full of cows
Ow
said Zaphod
My brains
You want to talk about it
said Ford
Yeah, OK, said Zaphod, and all three sat down and ignored the scenes that came and went around them
I figure this, said Zaphod
Whatever happened to my mind, I did it
And I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the government screening tests
And I wasn't to know anything about it myself
Pretty crazy, right
The other two nodded in agreement
So I reckon, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself
And the answer is I don't know
Obviously
But I put a few things together and I can begin to guess
When did I decide to run for President
Shortly after the death of President Yooden Vranx
You remember Yooden, Ford
Yeah, said Ford, he was that guy we met when we were kids, the Arcturan captain
He was a gas
He gave us conkers when you bust your way into his megafreighter
Said you were the most amazing kid he'd ever met
What's all this
said Trillian
Ancient history, said Ford, when we were kids together on Betelgeuse
The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying regions The Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturans would supply them
There was a lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields known to Galactic science
They were real brutes of ships, and huge
In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun
One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one
On a tri-jet scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid
I mean forget it, it was crazier than a mad monkey
I went along for the ride because I'd got some very safe money on him not doing it, and didn't want him coming back with fake evidence
So what happens
We got in his tri-jet which he had souped up into something totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust our way into a megafreighter I still don't know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers
A wilder thing I have not known
Lost me a year's pocket money
For what
Conkers
The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx, said Zaphod
He gave us food, booze — stuff from really weird parts of the Galaxy — lots of conkers of course, and we had just the most incredible time
Then he teleported us back
Into the maximum security wing of Betelgeuse state prison
He was a cool guy
Went on to become President of the Galaxy
Zaphod paused
The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom
Dark mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows
The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings
Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition
Ford, said Zaphod quietly
Yeah
Just before Yooden died he came to see me
What
You never told me
No
What did he say
What did he come to see you about
He told me about the Heart of Gold
It was his idea that I should steal it
His idea
Yeah, said Zaphod, and the only possible way of stealing it was to be at the launching ceremony
Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with laughter
Are you telling me, he said, that you set yourself up to become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship
That's it, said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls
But why
said Ford
What's so important about having it
Dunno, said Zaphod, I think if I'd consciously known what was so important about it and what I would need it for it would have showed up on the brain screening tests and I would never have passed
I think Yooden told me a lot of things that are still locked away
So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result of Yooden talking to you
He was a hell of a talker
Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you know
Zaphod shrugged
I mean, don't you have any inkling of the reasons for all this
asked Ford
Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his minds
No, he said at last, I don't seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets
Still, he added on further reflection, I can understand that
I wouldn't trust myself further than I could spit a rat
A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again
They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass-top tables and design awards
A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them
The mice will see you now, he said
So there you have it, said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study
He picked up a paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn't think of anywhere else to put it, so he but it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over
Deep Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it
And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed, added Arthur, not unbitterly
Yes, said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room
Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that
Ten million years, Earthman
can you conceive of that kind of time span
A galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in that time
Gone
He paused
Well that's bureaucracy for you, he added
You know, said Arthur thoughtfully, all this explains a lot of things
All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was
No, said the old man, that's just perfectly normal paranoia
Everyone in the Universe has that
Everyone
said Arthur
Well, if everyone has that perhaps it means something
Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know
Maybe
Who cares
said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited
Perhaps I'm old and tired, he continued, but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied
Look at me: I design coastlines
I got an award for Norway
He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded into it
Where's the sense in that
he said
None that I've been able to make out
I've been doing fjords in all my life
For a fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award
He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly, but not so carelessly that it didn't land on something soft
In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa to do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them, and I'm old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent
And they tell me it's not equatorial enough
Equatorial
He gave a hollow laugh
What does it matter
Science has achieved some wonderful things of course, but I'd far rather be happy than right any day
And are you
No
That's where it all falls down of course
Pity, said Arthur with sympathy
It sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise
Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed
Come, said Slartibartfast, you are to meet the mice
Your arrival on the planet has caused considerable excitement
It has already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the history of the Universe
What were the first two
Oh, probably just coincidences, said Slartibartfast carelessly
He opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow
Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning
I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle, he muttered to himself
I beg your pardon
said the old man mildly
Oh nothing, said Arthur, only joking
It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated
For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle, a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle
The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time
A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl'hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother
The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table
Unfortunately, in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries
Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own Galaxy — now positively identified as the source of the offending remark
For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across — which happened to be the Earth — where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog
Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it
It's just life, they say
A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a doorway
They left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of glass-topped tables and perspex awards
Almost immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room and they entered
Arthur
You're safe
a voice cried
Am I
said Arthur, rather startled
Oh good
The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits
They were stuffing their faces
What happened to you
demanded Arthur
Well, said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, our guests here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us
Here, he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from a bowl, have some Vegan Rhino's cutlet
It's delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing
Hosts
said Arthur
What hosts
I don't see any
A small voice said, Welcome to lunch, Earth creature
Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped
Ugh
he said
There are mice on the table
There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur
He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like whisky glasses on the table
He heard the silence and glanced around at everyone
Oh
he said, with sudden realization
Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't quite prepared for
Let me introduce you, said Trillian
Arthur this is Benji mouse
Hi, said one of the mice
His whiskers stroked what must have been a touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky-glass like affair, and it moved forward slightly
And this is Frankie mouse
The other mouse said, Pleased to meet you, and did likewise
Arthur gaped
But aren't they
Yes, said Trillian, they are the mice I brought with me from the Earth
She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug
Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey
she said
Slartibartfast coughed politely
Er, excuse me, he said
Yes, thank you Slartibartfast, said Benji mouse sharply, you may go
What
Oh
er, very well, said the old man, slightly taken aback, I'll just go and get on with some of my fjords then
Ah, well in fact that won't be necessary, said Frankie mouse
It looks very much as if we won't be needing the new Earth any longer
He swivelled his pink little eyes
Not now that we have found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed
What
cried Slartibartfast, aghast
You can't mean that
I've got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa
Well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle them, said Frankie, acidly
Skiing holiday
cried the old man
Those glaciers are works of art
Elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines
It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art
Thank you Slartibartfast, said Benji firmly
That will be all
Yes sir, said the old man coldly, thank you very much
Well, goodbye Earthman, he said to Arthur, hope the lifestyle comes together
With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked sadly out of the room
Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say
Now, said Benji mouse, to business
Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together
To business
they said
I beg your pardon
said Benji
Ford looked round
Sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast, he said
The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports
Finally they composed themselves, and Benji moved forward to address Arthur
Now, Earth creature, he said, the situation we have in effect is this
We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called the Ultimate Question
Why
said Arthur, sharply
No — we already thought of that one, said Frankie interrupting, but it doesn't fit the answer
Why
Forty-Two
you see, it doesn't work
No, said Arthur, I mean why have you been doing it
Oh, I see, said Frankie
Well, eventually just habit I think, to be brutally honest
And this is more or less the point — we're sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet-ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean
It was by the merest lucky chance that Benji and I finished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good offices of your friends
Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension, put in Benji
Since when, continued his murine colleague, we have had an offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D chat show and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and we're very much inclined to take it
I would, wouldn't you Ford
said Zaphod promptingly
Oh yes, said Ford, jump at it, like a shot
Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to
But we've got to have a product you see, said Frankie, I mean ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or other
Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur
You see, he said, if they're just sitting there in the studio looking very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then eventually have to admit that in fact it's Forty-two, then the show's probably quite short
No follow-up, you see
We have to have something that sounds good, said Benji
Something that sounds good
exclaimed Arthur
An Ultimate Question that sounds good
From a couple of mice
The mice bristled
Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I'm afraid where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth, it's that the entire multi-dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs
And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise, said Frankie
But
started Arthur, hopelessly
Hey, will you get this, Earthman, interrupted Zaphod
You are a last generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were there right up to the moment your planet got the finger, yeah
Er
So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer programme, said Ford, rather lucidly he thought
Right
said Zaphod
Well, said Arthur doubtfully
He wasn't aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything
He had always seen this as one of his problems
In other words, said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, there's a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain — so we want to buy it off you
What, the question
said Arthur
Yes, said Ford and Trillian
For lots of money, said Zaphod
No, no, said Frankie, it's the brain we want to buy
What
I thought you said you could just read his brain electronically, protested Ford
Oh yes, said Frankie, but we'd have to get it out first
It's got to be prepared
Treated, said Benji
Diced
Thank you, shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away from the table in horror
It could always be replaced, said Benji reasonably, if you think it's important
Yes, an electronic brain, said Frankie, a simple one would suffice
A simple one
wailed Arthur
Yeah, said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, you'd just have to program it to say What
and I don't understand and Where's the tea
who'd know the difference
What
cried Arthur, backing away still further
See what I mean
said Zaphod and howled with pain because of something that Trillian did at that moment
I'd notice the difference, said Arthur
No you wouldn't, said Frankie mouse, you'd be programmed not to
Ford made for the door
Look, I'm sorry, mice old lads, he said
I don't think we've got a deal
I rather think we have to have a deal, said the mice in chorus, all the charm vanishing fro their piping little voices in an instant
With a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the table, and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think of anything
Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open, but Arthur was dead weight - he seemed hypnotized by the airborne rodents swooping towards him
She screamed at him, but he just gaped
With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open
On the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea
Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty
They charged
So — Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were
All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din
Emergency
Emergency
blared the klaxons throughout Magrathea
Hostile ship has landed on planet
Armed intruders in section 8A
Defence stations, defence stations
The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass transports where they lay shattered on the floor
Damnation, muttered Frankie mouse, all that fuss over two pounds of Earthling brain
He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static
The only thing we can do now, said Benji, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, is to try and fake a question, invent one that will sound plausible
Difficult, said Frankie
He thought
How about What's yellow and dangerous
Benji considered this for a moment
No, no good, he said
Doesn't fit the answer
They sank into silence for a few seconds
Alright, said Benji
What do you get if you multiply six by seven
No, no, too literal, too factual, said Frankie, wouldn't sustain the punters' interest
Again they thought
Then Frankie said: Here's a thought
How many roads must a man walk down
Ah, said Benji
Aha, now that does sound promising
He rolled the phrase around a little
Yes, he said, that's excellent
Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all
How many roads must a man walk down
Forty-two
Excellent, excellent, that'll fox 'em
Frankie baby, we are made
They performed a scampering dance in their excitement
Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards
Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a way out
They emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay
They glanced about wildly
Which way do you reckon Zaphod
said Ford
At a wild guess, I'd say down here, said Zaphod, running off down to the right between a computer bank and the wall
As the others started after him he was brought up short by a Kill-O-Zap energy bolt that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall
A voice on a loud hailer said, OK Beeblebrox, hold it right there
We've got you covered
Cops
hissed Zaphod, and span around in a crouch
You want to try a guess at all, Ford
OK, this way, said Ford, and the four of them ran down a gangway between two computer banks
At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space-suited figure waving a vicious Kill-O-Zap gun
We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox
shouted the figure
Suits me fine
shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units
The others swerved in behind him
There are two of them, said Trillian
We're cornered
They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall
They held their breath and waited
Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously
Hey, they're shooting at us, said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, I thought they said they didn't want to do that
Yeah, I thought they said that, agreed Ford
Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment
Hey, he said, I thought you said you didn't want to shoot us
and ducked again
They waited
After a moment a voice replied, It isn't easy being a cop
What did he say
whispered Ford in astonishment
He said it isn't easy being a cop
Well surely that's his problem isn't it
I'd have thought so
Ford shouted out, Hey listen
I think we've got enough problems on our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it easier to cope
Another pause, and then the loud hailer again
Now see here, guy, said the voice on the loud hailer, you're not dealing with any dumb two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we're a couple of intelligent caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you met us socially
I don't go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space-rangers bars, like some cops I could mention
I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend
And I write novels
chimed in the other cop
Though I haven't had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I'm in a meeeean mood
Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets
Who are these guys
he said
Dunno, said Zaphod, I think I preferred it when they were shooting
So are you going to come quietly, shouted one of the cops again, or are you going to let us blast you out
Which would you prefer
shouted Ford
A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after bolt of Kill-O-Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them
The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity
When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness ad the echoes died away
You still there
called one of the cops
Yes, they called back
We didn't enjoy doing that at all, shouted the other cop
We could tell, shouted Ford
Now, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good
Why
shouted Back Zaphod
Because, shouted the cop, it's going to be very intelligent, and quite interesting and humane
Now either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our way out here
But that's crazy
cried Trillian
You wouldn't do that
Oh yes we would, shouted the cop, wouldn't we
he asked the other one
Oh yes, we'd have to, no question, the other one called back
But why
demanded Trillian
Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and everything
I just don't believe these guys, muttered Ford, shaking his head
One cop shouted to the other, Shall we shoot them again for a bit
Yeah, why not
They let fly another electric barrage
The heat and noise was quite fantastic
Slowly, the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate
The front had almost all melted away, and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back towards where they were squatting
They huddled further back and waited for the end
But the end never came, at least not then
Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds
The four stared at each other
What happened
said Arthur
They stopped, said Zaphod with a shrug
Why
Dunno, do you want to go and ask them
No
They waited
Hello
called out Ford
No answer
That's odd
Perhaps it's a trap
They haven't the wit
What were those thuds
Dunno
They waited for a few more seconds
Right, said Ford, I'm going to have a look
He glanced round at the others
Is no one going to say, No you can't possibly, let me go instead
They all shook their heads
Oh well, he said, and stood up
For a moment, nothing happened
Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen
Ford peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer
Cautiously he stepped out into the open
Still nothing happened
Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space-suited figure of one of the cops
He was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground
Twenty yards in the other direction lay the second man
No one else was anywhere to be seen
This struck Ford as being extremely odd
Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one
The body lay reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on the Kill-O-Zap gun that still dangled from its limp fingers
He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance
The cop was quite clearly dead
A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa — he was a methane-breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea
The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have blown up
Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment
These miniature suit computers usually had the full back-up of the main computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked through the sub-etha
Such a system was fail-safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of
He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably simultaneously
He called the others over to look
They came, shared his astonishment, but not his curiosity
Let's get shot out of this hole, said Zaphod
If whatever I'm supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it
He grabbed the second Kill-O-Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others
He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away
The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to Slartibartfast
It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel
The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls
It said, This is probably the best button to press
The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight
Ghastly grey lights congealed on the land
R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late
It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor
Unless handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death
R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast
The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important business of its own
Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship
Beside it stood another one
It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike affair, slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness
The letters informed anyone who cared to read them as to where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds should be connected
It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two-man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a smoke-filled chamber several miles beneath the ground
It is one of those curious things that is impossible to explain or define, but one can sense when a ship is completely dead
Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious — a ship and two policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead
In his experience the Universe simply didn't work like that
The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suffering from an acute attack of no curiosity
Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship
As he walked, he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust
Marvin
he exclaimed
What are you doing
Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please, came a muffled drone
But how are you, metalman
said Ford
Very depressed
What's up
I don't know, said Marvin, I've never been there
Why, said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, are you lying face down in the dust
It's a very effective way of being wretched, said Marvin
Don't pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me
No I don't
Yes you do, everybody does
It's part of the shape of the Universe
I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me
Even robots hate me
If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away
He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction
That ship hated me, he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft
That ship
said Ford in sudden excitement
What happened to it
Do you know
It hated me because I talked to it
You talked to it
exclaimed Ford
What do you mean you talked to it
Simple
I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed
I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it, said Marvin
And what happened
pressed Ford
It committed suicide, said Marvin and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold
That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
Since he was going to live in the place, he reasoned, he'd better start finding out something about it
He came across this entry
It said: 'The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases
For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat
the second by the question Why do we eat
and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch
He got no further before the ship's intercom buzzed into life
Hey Earthman
You hungry kid
said Zaphod's voice
Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose, said Arthur
OK baby, hold tight, said Zaphod
We'll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe
There is a theory which states  that  if  ever  anyone  discovers exactly  what  the  Universe  is  for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear  and  be  replaced  by  something  even  more bizarre and inexplicable
There is another  theory  which  states  that  this  has  already happened
The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
Many races believe that it was  created  by  some  sort  of  God, though  the  Jatravartid  people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose  of  a  being called the Great Green Arkleseizure
The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear  of  the  time  they call  The  Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than  fifty  arms  each,  who  are  therefore unique  in  being  the  only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel
However, the  Great  Green  Arkleseizure  Theory  is  not  widely accepted  outside  Viltvodle  VI  and  so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other  explanations  are  constantly  being sought
For instance, a race of hyperintelligent  pan-dimensional  beings once  built  themselves  a  gigantic  supercomputer  called  Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the  Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything
For seven and a half million years,  Deep  Thought  computed  and calculated,  and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty-two - and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large  that it  was  frequently  mistaken  for  a  planet - especially by the strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface,  totally  unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program
And this is very odd, because  without  that  fairly  simple  and obvious  piece  of  knowledge,  nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense
Sadly however, just before the critical moment  of  readout,  the Earth  was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way - so they claimed - for a new hyperspace bypass, and so  all  hope  of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever
Or so it would seem
Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived
Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of  his,  Ford  Prefect,  suddenly  turned out to be from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had  hitherto  claimed;  and,  more  to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers
Tricia McMillian - or Trillian  -  had  skipped  the  planet  six months  earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy
Two survivors
They are  all  that  remains  of  the  greatest  experiment  ever conducted - to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe, and Everything
And, less than half a million miles from where their starship  is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them
Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it  had  been  not  so  much designed  as  congealed
The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices
which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have  disfigured the  looks  of  most  ships,  but  in  this  case  that was sadly impossible
Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not
by reliable witnesses
In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship  you  would have  to go inside and look at a Vogon
If you are wise, however,
this is precisely what you will avoid doing because  the  average Vogon  will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been  born  -  or (if  you  are  a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born
In fact, the average Vogon probably  wouldn't  even  think  once
They are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and thinking is not really something they are cut out for
Anatomical
analysis  of  the  Vogon  reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver
The fairest  thing
you  can  say about them, then, is that they know what they like, and  what  they  like  generally  involves  hurting  people  and, wherever possible, getting very angry
One  thing  they  don't  like  is  leaving  a  job  unfinished  - particularly this Vogon, and particularly - for various reasons - this job
This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of demolishing the so-called planet Earth
He heaved his monumentally vile body round  in  his  ill-fitting, slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned
It mattered little to him  that  the  Heart  of  Gold,  with  its Infinite   Improbability   Drive,  was  the  most  beautiful  and revolutionary ship ever built
Aesthetics  and  technology  were
closed  books  to  him  and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well
It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox  was  aboard
Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  now  the ex-President of the Galaxy, and though every police force in the Galaxy  was  currently  pursuing both  him  and  this  ship  he  had  stolen,  the  Vogon  was not interested
He had other fish to fry
It has been said that Vogons are not above a little  bribery  and corruption  in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case
When he heard the  words
integrity  or moral rectitude, he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away
In seeking so implacably the destruction of  the  Earth  and  all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty
There was even some doubt as to whether
the  said  bypass  was actually going to be built, but the matter had been glossed over
He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction
Computer, he croaked, get me my brain care specialist  on  the line
Within a few seconds the face of Gag  Halfrunt  appeared  on  the screen,  smiling  the  smile  of  a man who knew he was ten light years away from the Vogon  face  he  was  looking  at
Mixed  up
somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too
Though the Vogon persistently  referred  to  him  as  my   private   brain   care
specialist  there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon
He  was  paying
him  an  awful lot of money to do some very dirty work
As one of the Galaxy's most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he  and
a  consortium  of  his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it  seemed  that  the  entire  future  of psychiatry might be at stake
Well, he said, hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and  how are we feeling today
The Vogon captain told him that in the  last  few  hours  he  had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise
Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant
Well, he said, I think this is perfectly normal behaviour  for a  Vogon,  you  know
The natural and healthy channelling of the
aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence
That, rumbled the Vogon, is what you always say
Well again, said Halfrunt, I  think  that  this  is  perfectly normal  behaviour  for  a psychiatrist
Good
We are clearly both
very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today
Now  tell  me, what news of the mission
We have located the ship
Wonderful, said Halfrunt, wonderful
and the occupants
The Earthman is there
Excellent
And
A female from the same planet
They are the last
Good, good, beamed Halfrunt, Who else
The man Prefect
Yes
And Zaphod Beeblebrox
For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered
Ah yes, he said,  I  had  been  expecting  this
It  is  most regrettable
A personal friend
inquired  the  Vogon,  who  had  heard  the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out
Ah, no, said Halfrunt, in my profession you know,  we  do  not make personal friends
Ah, grunted the Vogon, professional detachment
No, said Halfrunt cheerfully, we just don't have the knack
He paused
His mouth continued to smile,  but  his  eyes  frowned slightly
But Beeblebrox, you know, he  said,  he  is  one  of  my  most profitable clients
He had personality problems beyond the dreams
of analysts
He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it
Still, he said, you are ready for your task
Yes
Good
Destroy the ship immediately
What about Beeblebrox
Well, said Halfrunt brightly,  Zaphod's  just  this  guy,  you know
He vanished from the screen
The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button  which  connected him with the remains of his crew
Attack, he said
At that  precise  moment  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  in  his  cabin swearing  very loudly
Two hours ago, he had said that they would
go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, whereupon  he  had had a blazing row with the ship's computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that  he  would  work  out  the Improbability factors with a pencil
The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and  unpredictable  ship  in  existence
There  was  nothing  it
couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen
He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching it
He  didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he
liked it
He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy,  except that it seemed a fun thing to be
He did know that there were better reasons than these,  but  that they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains
He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away  because  they  occasionally  surfaced  momentarily  and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections  of  his  mind  and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time
At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time
He  had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry
Starpox
he shouted
At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in  mid  air
This was  not  because  of  anything  wrong with the ship's artificial
gravity field, but because he was  leaping  down  the  stair-well which  led to the ship's personal cabins
It was a very high jump
to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled,  recovered, raced  down  the  corridor  sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod's door and explained what was on his mind
Vogons, he said
A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in  search  of  a cup of tea
It was not a quest he embarked upon
with a great deal of optimism
because he  knew  that  the  only source  of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of
equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation
It  was called  a  Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered
it before
It claimed  to  produce  the  widest  possible  range  of  drinks personally  matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it
When put to the test, however, it invariably  produced
a  plastic  cup  filled  with  a  liquid that was almost, but nit quite, entirely unlike tea
He attempted to reason with the thing
Tea, he said
Share and Enjoy, the machine replied and provided him with  yet another cup of the sickly liquid
He threw it away
Share and enjoy, the machine repeated  and  provided  him  with another one
Share and Enjoy is the company motto of the  hugely  successful Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Complaints  division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the  only  part  of  the  Corporation  to have shown a consistent profit in recent years
The motto  stands  -  or  rather  stood  -  in  three  mile  high illuminated  letters  near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadrax
Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly  after  it
was  erected,  the  ground  beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of  many talented young complaints executives - now deceased
The protruding upper halves of the letters  now  appear,  in  the local language, to read Go stick your head in a pig, and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration
Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid
Listen, you machine, he said, you claim you can synthesize any drink  in  existence,  so  why  do  you  keep  giving me the same undrinkable stuff
Nutrition and pleasurable  sense  data,  burbled  the  machine
Share and Enjoy
It tastes filthy
If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink, continued the machine, why not share it with your friends
Because, said Arthur tartly, I want to keep them
Will you try to comprehend what I'm telling you
That drink
That  drink,  said  the  machine  sweetly,  was   individually tailored  to  meet  your  personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure
Ah, said Arthur, so I'm a masochist on diet am I
Share and Enjoy
Oh shut up
Will that be all
Arthur decided to give up
Yes, he said
Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up
No, he said, look, it's very, very simple
all I  want
is a cup of tea
You are going to make one for me
Keep quiet and listen
And he sat
He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about China,  he  told  it  about Ceylon
He told it about broad leaves
drying in the sun
He told it about silver teapots
He  told  it about  summer afternoons on the lawn
He told it about putting in
the milk before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded
He even  told it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company
So that's it, is it
said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished
Yes, said Arthur, that is what I want
You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water
Er, yes
With milk
Squirted out of a cow
Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose
I'm going to need some help with this  one,  said  the  machine tersely
All  the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice
and it now meant business
Well, anything I can do, said Arthur
You've done quite enough, the Nutri-Matic informed him
It summoned up the ship's computer
Hi there
said the ship's computer
The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's  computer
The computer  boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and
together they lapsed into a grim silence
Arthur watched and  waited  for  a  while,  but  nothing  further happened
He thumped it, but still nothing happened
Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge
In the empty wastes of space,  the  Heart  of  Gold  hung  still
Around  it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy
Towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship
Does anyone have a kettle
Arthur asked as he walked on to  the bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at
the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod  was kicking  it,  and  also  why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen
He put down the empty cup he was  carrying  and  walked  over  to them
Hello
he said
At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the  polished  marble surfaces  that  contained  the  instruments  that  controlled the conventional photon drive
They materialized  beneath  his  hands
and  he  flipped over to manual control
He pushed, he pulled, he pressed and he swore
The photon drive gave a sickly  judder  and
cut out again
Something up
said Arthur
Hey, didja hear that
muttered Zaphod as he leapt now  for  the manual  controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, the monkey
spoke
The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then  also  cut out
Pure history,  man,  said  Zaphod,  kicking  the  Improbability Drive, a talking monkey
If you're upset about something
said Arthur
Vogons
snapped Ford, we're under attack
Arthur gibbered
Well what are you doing
Let's get out of here
Can't
Computer's jammed
Jammed
It says all its circuits are occupied
There's no power anywhere in the ship
Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across his forehead and slumped back against the wall
Nothing we can do, he said
He glared at nothing  and  bit  his lip
When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the  Earth  had been demolished, he had used to play football
He had not been at
all good at it, and his particular speciality  had  been  scoring own goals in important matches
Whenever this happened he used to
experience a peculiar tingling round the back of  his  neck  that would  slowly  creep  up across his cheeks and heat his brow
The
image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering  boys  flinging it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment
A peculiar tingling  sensation  at  the  back  of  his  neck  was creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow
He started to speak, and stopped
He started to speak again and stopped again
Finally he managed to speak
Er, he said
He cleared his throat
Tell me, he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all  turned to stare at him
He glanced at the approaching yellow
blob on the vision screen
Tell me,  he  said  again,  did  the  computer  say  what  was occupying it
I just ask out of interest
Their eyes were riveted on him
And, er
well that's it really, just asking
Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck
What have you done to it, Monkeyman
he breathed
Well, said Arthur, nothing in fact
It's just that I  think  a short while ago it was trying to work out how to
Yes
Make me some tea
That's right guys, the computer sang out suddenly, just coping with  that  problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy
Be with you
in a while
It lapsed back into a silence that was only  matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at
Arthur Dent
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons  chose  that  moment  to start firing
The ship shook, the  ship  thundered
Outside,  the  inch  thick force-shield  around  it  blistered,  crackled and spat under the
barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon,  and looked  as if it wouldn't be around for long
Four minutes is how
long Ford Prefect gave it
Three minutes and fifty  seconds,  he said a short while later
Forty-five seconds,  he  added  at  the  appropriate  time
He flicked  idly  at  some  useless  switches,  then  gave Arthur an
unfriendly look
Dying for a cup of tea, eh
he said
Three minutes  and  forty seconds
Will you stop counting
snarled Zaphod
Yes, said Ford  Prefect,  in  three  minutes  and  thirty-five seconds
Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled
He had expected  a  chase,  he  had  expected  an  exciting grapple with
tractor beams, he had expected  to  have  to  use  the  specially installed Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Heart of  Gold's  Infinite  Improbability  Drive,  but  the  Sub-Cyclic Normality  Assert-i-Tron  lay  idle as the Heart of Gold just sat there and took it
A dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil  Photrazon  Cannon  continued  to blaze  away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and took it
He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if  there  was  any subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found
He didn't know about the tea of course
Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the  Heart  of  Gold were  spending  the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they had left to spend
Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at  the  idea  of  holding  a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on
Obviously the subject of death  was  in  the  air,  but  more  as something to be avoided than harped upon
Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at  the  prospect  of being  reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the same  way  about  him  and,  what's more,  be  able  to  do  something about helping to postpone this reunion
Or again it might just have been one of  the  strange  promptings that  occasionally  surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the Galaxy
You want to talk to your great grandfather
boggled Ford
Yeah
Does it have to be now
The ship continued to shake  and  thunder
The  temperature  was rising
The  light  was  getting  dimmer  -  all  the energy the
computer didn't require for thinking about tea was  being  pumped into the rapidly fading force-field
Yeah
insisted Zaphod
Listen Ford, I think he may be able  to help us
Are you sure you mean think
Pick your words with care
Suggest something else we can do
Er, well
OK,  round  the  central  console
Now
Come   on
Trillian, Monkeyman, move
They clustered round the central console in confusion,  sat  down and,  feeling  exceptionally  foolish, held hands
With his third
hand Zaphod turned off the lights
Darkness gripped the ship
Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon  continued to rip at the force-field
Concentrate, hissed Zaphod, on his name
What is it
asked Arthur
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth
What
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth
Concentrate
The Fourth
Yeah
Listen,  I'm  Zaphod  Beeblebrox,  my  father  was  Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third
What
There was an accident with a contraceptive and a  time  machine
Now concentrate
Three minutes, said Ford Prefect
Why, said Arthur Dent, are we doing this
Shut up, suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox
Trillian said nothing
What, she thought, was there to say
The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far  corner  where  Marvin  the  Paranoid  Android  sat  slumped, ignoring all  and  ignored  by  all,  in  a  private  and  rather unpleasant world of his own
Round  the  central  console  four  figures  hunched   in   tight concentration  trying  to  blot  from  their minds the terrifying shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that  echoed  through it
They concentrated
Still they concentrated
And still they concentrated
The seconds ticked by
On Zaphod's brow stood beads of sweat,  first  of  concentration, then of frustration and finally of embarrassment
At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his  hands  from Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch
Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn  the  lights  on, said  a  voice
No,  not too bright please, my eyes aren't what
they once were
Four figures jolted upright in their seats
Slowly  they  turned their  heads  to  look,  though  their  scalps  showed a distinct
propensity to try and stay in the same place
Now
Who disturbs me at this time
said the small, bent,  gaunt figure  standing  by  the  sprays  of  fern at the far end of the
bridge
His two small wispy-haired heads looked so  ancient  that it  seemed  they  might  hold  dim  memories  of the birth of the
galaxies themselves
One lolled in sleep, but the other  squinted sharply  at  them
If his eyes weren't what they once were, they
must once have been diamond cutters
Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment
He  gave  the  intricate little  double  nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture
of familial respect
Oh
er, hi Great Granddad
he breathed
The little old  figure  moved  closer  towards  them
He  peered through  the  dim light
He thrust out a bony finger at his great
grandson
Ah, he snapped
Zaphod Beeblebrox
The last of our great line
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth
The First
The Nothingth, spat the figure
Zaphod  hated  his  voice
It always  seemed  to  him  to  screech  like fingernails across the
blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul
He shifted awkwardly in his seat
Er, yeah, he muttered, Er, look, I'm really  sorry  about  the flowers,  I  meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was fresh out of wreaths and
You forget
snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth
Well
Too busy
Never think of other people
The living  are  all  the same
Two minutes, Zaphod, whispered Ford in an awed whisper
Zaphod fidgeted nervously
Yeah, but I did mean to send them, he said
And I'll write  to my  great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this
Your great  grandmother,  mused  the  gaunt  little  figure  to himself
Yeah, said Zaphod, Er, how is she
Tell you what, I'll go  and see her
But first we've just got to
Your late great grandmother and I are very well, rasped  Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth
Ah
Oh
But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod
Yeah well
Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this  conversation,  and  Ford's heavy breathing at his side told
him that the seconds were ticking away fast
The  noise  and  the shaking  had  reached terrifying proportions
He saw Trillian and
Arthur's faces white and unblinking in the gloom
Er, Great Grandfather
We've been following your progress with considerable despondency
Yeah, look, just at the moment you see
Not to say contempt
Could you sort of listen for a moment
I mean what exactly are you doing with your life
I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet
cried Zaphod
It  was  an exaggeration,  but  it was his only opportunity so far of getting
the basic point of the exercise across
Doesn't surprise me in the least, said the  little  old  figure with a shrug
Only  it's  happening  right  now  you  see,  insisted   Zaphod feverishly
The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur  Dent  had brought in and looked at it with interest
Er
Great Granddad
Did you know, interrupting the ghostly  figure,  fixing  Zaphod with  a  stern  look,  that Betelgeuse Five has developed a very slight eccentricy in its orbit
Zaphod didn't and found the information hard  to  concentrate  on what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on
Er, no
look, he said
Me spinning in my grave
barked the ancestor
He  slammed  the cup  down  and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger
at Zaphod
Your fault
he screeched
One minute thirty, muttered Ford, his head in his hands
Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because
Help
exclaimed the old man as if he'd been asked for a stoat
Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise
Help
repeated the old man as if he'd been asked for a  lightly grilled stoat in a bun with French fries
He stood amazed
You go swanning your way round the Galaxy  with  your
the ancestor  waved  a  contemptuous  hand,  with  your disreputable
friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones  would have  done,  would  have been quite appropriate from you, but no
Too busy
Too modern
Too sceptical  -  till  you  suddenly  find yourself  in  a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally-
minded
He shook his head - carefully, so as not to disturb  the  slumber of the other one, which was already becoming restive
Well, I don't know, young Zaphod, he continued, I  think  I'll have to think about this one
One minute ten, said Ford hollowly
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously
Why does that man keep talking in numbers
he said
Those numbers, said Zaphod tersely, are  the  time  we've  got left to live
Oh, said his great grandfather
He grunted to himself
Doesn't apply to me, of course, he said and moved off to a dimmer recess
of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at
Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and  wondered if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it
Great Grandfather, he said, It applies to  us
We  are  still alive, and we are about to lose our lives
Good job too
What
What use is your life to anyone
When I  think  of  what  you've made of it the phrase `pig's ear' comes irresistibly to my mind
But I was President of the Galaxy, man
Huh, muttered his ancestor, And what kind of a job is that for a Beeblebrox
Hey, what
Only President you know
Of the whole Galaxy
Conceited little megapuppy
Zaphod blinked in bewilderment
Hey, er, what are you at, man
I mean Great Grandfather
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped  him sternly on the knee
This had the effect of reminding
Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he  didn't  feel  a thing
You know and I know what being President  means,  young  Zaphod
You  know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective
We  have
a saying up here
Life is wasted on the living
Yeah, said Zaphod bitterly, very good
Very deep
Right now  I
need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads
Fifty seconds, grunted Ford Prefect
Where was I
said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth
Pontificating, said Zaphod Beeblebrox
Oh yes
Can this guy, muttered Ford quietly  to  Zaphod,  actually  in fact help us
Nobody else can, whispered Zaphod
Ford nodded despondently
Zaphod
the ghost was saying,  you  became  President  of  the Galaxy for a reason
Have you forgotten
Could we go into this later
Have you forgotten
insisted the ghost
Yeah
Of course I forgot
I had  to  forget
They  screen  your brain when you get the job you know
If they'd found my head full
of tricksy ideas I'd have been right out  on  the  streets  again with  nothing  but  a  fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of ships and a couple of slit throats
Ah, nodded the ghost in satisfaction, then you do remember
He paused for a moment
Good, he said and the noise stopped
Forty-eight seconds, said Ford
He looked again  at  his  watch and tapped it
He looked up
Hey, the noise has stopped, he said
A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes
I've slowed down time for a moment, he said, just for a moment you understand
I would hate you to miss all I have to say
No, you listen to me, you  see-through  old  bat,  said  Zaphod leaping  out  of his chair, A - thanks for stopping time and all that, great, terrific, wonderful, but  B  -  no  thanks  for  the homily, right
I don't know what this great think I'm meant to be
doing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed  not  to  know
And I resent that, right
The old me knew
The old me cared
Fine, so far so hoopy
Except that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own
brain - my own brain - and locked off  the  bits  that  knew  and cared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn't be able to do it
I
wouldn't be able to go and be President, and I wouldn't  be  able to steal this ship, which must be the important thing
But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't  he,  by changing  my  brain
OK, that was his choice
This new me has its
own choices to make, and by a strange coincidence  those  choices involve  not  knowing  and  not  caring  about  this  big number, whatever it is
That's what he wanted, that's what he got
Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in  control, leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off
Well,
I don't want to know, and I don't want to hear  them
That's  my choice
I'm not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my
own
Zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious  to  the  dumbfolded looks he was attracting
The old me  is  dead
he  raved,  Killed  himself
The  dead shouldn't hang about trying to interfere with the living
And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape, said  the ghost
Ah, said Zaphod, sitting down  again,  well  that's  different isn't it
He grinned at Trillian, weakly
Zaphod, rasped the apparition, I think the only reason I waste my  breath  on  you is that being dead I don't have any other use for it
OK, said Zaphod, why don't you tell me what the big secret is
Try me
Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy,  as  did Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing
A cipher
Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something, with  ultimate  power
That man, or being, or something, you must
find - the man who controls this  Galaxy,  and  -  we  suspect  - others
Possibly the entire Universe
Why
Why
exclaimed an astonished ghost, Why
Look around you  lad, does it look to you as if it's in very good hands
It's alright
The old ghost glowered at him
I will not argue with you
You will simply take this ship,  this Improbability  Drive  ship to where it is needed
You will do it
Don't think you can escape your purpose
The Improbability  Field controls you, you are in its grip
What's this
He was standing tapping at one of  the  terminals  of  Eddie  the Shipboard Computer
Zaphod told him
What's it doing
It is trying, said Zaphod with wonderful  restraint,  to  make tea
Good, said his great  grandfather,  I  approve  of  that
Now Zaphod,  he  said, turning and wagging a finger at him, I don't
know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job
I think you will not be able to avoid it
However, I am too long dead and
too tired to care as much as I did
The  principal  reason  I  am helping  you  now  is that I couldn't bear the thought of you and
your modern friends slouching about up here
Understood
Yeah, thanks a bundle
Oh, and Zaphod
Er, yeah
If you ever find you need help again, you  know,  if  you're  in trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner
Yeah
Please don't hesitate to get lost
Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from  the wizened  old  ghost's  hands to the computer, the ghost vanished, the bridge filled with billowing smoke  and  the  Heart  of  Gold leapt  an  unknown  distance  through  the dimensions of time and space
Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several notches
As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed
across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon  ship,  he  saw the final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away, and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke
Good, he thought
The end of the last stray survivors  of  the  demolition  he  had ordered on the planet Earth, he thought
The final end of this dangerous (to the  psychiatric  profession) and subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to find the Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, he thought
There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and  in the  morning  they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and highly profitable patients, secure  in  the  knowledge  that  the Meaning  of  Life  would  not  now be, once and for all, well and truly sorted out, he thought
Family's always embarrassing isn't it
said Ford to  Zaphod  as the smoke began to clear
He paused, then looked about
Where's Zaphod
he said
Arthur and Trillian looked about  blankly
They  were  pale  and shaken and didn't know where Zaphod was
Marvin
said Ford, Where's Zaphod
A moment later he said: Where's Marvin
The robot's corner was empty
The ship was  utterly  silent
It  lay  in  thick  black  space
Occasionally  it  rocked  and  swayed
Every instrument was dead, every vision screen was dead
They  consulted  the  computer
It
said: I  regret  that  I  have  been   temporarily   closed   to   all communication
Meanwhile, here is some light music
They turned off the light music
They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment and  alarm
Everywhere was dead and silent
Nowhere was there any
trace of Zaphod or of Marvin
One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the Nutri-Matic machine was located
On the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was  a small  tray,  on  which  sat three bone china cups and saucers, a bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot  full  of  the  best  tea Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying Wait
Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in the known Universe
Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny  and  more full  of  wonderfully  exciting  people  than a pomegranate is of pips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a  recent  edition of  Playbeing  magazine headlined an article with the words When you are tired of Ursa Minor Beta you  are  tired  of  life,  the suicide rate quadrupled overnight
Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta
It is a West Zone planet which by an  inexplicable  and  somewhat suspicious  freak  of topography consists almost entirely of sub- tropical coastline
By an equally suspicious  freak  of  temporal
relastatics,  it  is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close
No adequate explanation for this has been  forthcoming  from  the dominant  lifeforms  on  Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their time attempting to achieve  spiritual  enlightenment  by  running round  swimming  pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form the Galactic Geo-Temporal Control Board to have a  nice  diurnal anomaly
There is only one city on Ursa  Minor  Beta,  and  that  is  only called  a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground there than elsewhere
If you approach Light City by air - and there is no other way  of approaching  it,  no roads, no port facilities - if you don't fly they don't want to see you in Light City - you will  see  why  it has  this  name
Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering
on the  swimming  pools,  shimmering  on  the  white,  palm-lined boulevards,  glistening  on  the healthy bronzed specks moving up and down them, gleaming off the villas,  the  hazy  airpads,  the beach bars and so on
Most particularly it shines  on  a  building,  a  tall  beautiful building  consisting  of two thirty-storey white towers connected by a bridge half-way up their length
The building is the home of a book, and was  built  here  on  the proceeds  of  an  extraordinary copyright law suit fought between the book's editors and a breakfast cereal company
The book is a guide book, a travel book
It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most  successful, books  ever  to  come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor - more popular than Life Begins at  Five  Hundred  and Fifty,  better selling than The Big Bang Theory - A Personal View by Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore  of  Eroticon Six)   and  more  controversial  than  Oolon  Colluphid's  latest blockbusting title Everything You Never Wanted To Know About  Sex But Have Been Forced To Find Out
And in many of the  more  relaxed  civilizations  on  the  Outer Eastern  Rim  of  the  Galaxy,  it  has long surplanted the great Encyclopaedia  Galactica  as  the  standard  repository  of   all knowledge  and  wisdom,  for  though  it  has  many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly  inaccurate, it  scores  over  the  older  and  more  pedestrian  work  in two important respects
First, it is slightly cheaper,  and  secondly
it has the words Don't Panic printed in large friendly letters on its cover

It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who  want to  see  the  marvels  of the known Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day - The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
If you stood with your back to the main  entrance  lobby  of  the Guide  offices  (assuming  you had landed by now and freshened up with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass along  the  leafy  shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale golden colour of  the  beaches  stretching  away  to  your  left, astounded  by the mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves as if  it  was  nothing  special,  surprised  and eventually  slightly  irritated  by the giant palm trees that hum toneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in  other  words continuously
If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you  would  enter the  Lalamatine  district  of  shops,  bolonut trees and pavement cafes where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard  afternoon's relaxation  on the beach
The Lalamatine district is one of those
very few areas which doesn't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon -  it  enjoys  instead  the  cool  of  a perpetual early Saturday evening
Behind it lie the night clubs
If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of  eveningtime  - call  it  what  you will - you had approached the second pavement cafe on the right you would have seen  the  usual  crowd  of  UM- Betans  chatting,  drinking,  looking  very relaxed, and casually glancing at each other's watches to see how expensive they were
You would also have seen a couple of rather  dishevelled  looking hitch-hikers  from  Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan Megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it  for  a  few days
They  were  angry  and  bewildered  to discover that here,
within sight of the Hitch Hiker's Guide building itself, a simple glass  of  fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altairan dollars
Sell out, one of them said, bitterly
If at that moment you had then looked at the next table  but  one you  would  have  seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very startled and confused
The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold
Absolute sell out, said the voice again
Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two dishevelled  hitch-hikers  at  the next table
Where the hell was
he
How had he got there
Where was his ship
His hand  felt  the arm  of  the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in
front of him
They seemed solid enough
He sat very still
How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in  a  place like this
continued the voice
I mean look at it
Look at it
Zaphod was looking at it
Nice place, he thought
But where
And why
He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses
In  the same  pocket  he  felt  a  hard smooth, unidentified lump of very
heavy metal
He pulled it out and looked at it
He blinked at  it in  surprise
Where had he got that
He returned it to his pocket
and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to  discover  that  the  metal object  had  scratched  one  of the lenses
Nevertheless, he felt
much more comfortable with them on
They were a  double  pair  of Joo  Janta  200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which
had been specially designed to  help  people  develop  a  relaxed attitude  to  danger
At  the  first  hint  of trouble they turn
totally black and thus prevent  you  from  seeing  anything  that might alarm you
Apart from the scratch the lenses were  clear
He  relaxed,  but only a little bit
The angry hitch-hiker  continued  to  glare  at  his  monstrously expensive fruit juice
Worst thing that ever happened to  the  Guide,  moving  to  Ursa Minor  Beta, he grumbled, they've all gone soft
You know, I've
even   heard  that   they've  created  a   whole   electronically synthesized  Universe  in one of their offices so they can go and research stories during the day and still go to  parties  in  the evening
Not that day and evening mean much in this place
Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod
At least he knew  where  he  was now
He assumed that this must be his great grandfather's doing,
but why
Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into  his  mind
It  was very  clear  and  very distinct, and he had now come to recognize
these thoughts for what they were
His  instinct  was  to  resist them
They  were  the  pre-ordained promptings from the dark and
locked off parts of his mind
He sat still and ignored the thought furiously
It nagged at him
He ignored it
It nagged at him
He ignored it
It nagged at him
He gave in to it
What the hell, he thought, go with the flow
He  was  too  tired, confused  and  hungry  to  resist
He  didn't even know what the
thought meant
Hello
Yes
Megadodo Publications, home  of  the  Hitch  Hiker's Guide  to  the  Galaxy,  the  most totally remarkable book in the
whole of the known Universe, can I  help  you
said  the  large pink-winged  insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along
the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices
It fluttered its wings
and  rolled  its  eyes
It  glared  at  all  the  grubby  people cluttering  up  the  foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty
handmarks on the upholstery
It  adored  working  for  the  Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of
keeping all the hitch-hikers  away
Weren't  they  meant  to  be hanging  round dirty spaceports or something
It was certain that
it had read something somewhere in the book about the  importance of  hanging  round  dirty  spaceports
Unfortunately most of them
seemed to come and hang around in this  nice  clean  shiny  foyer after  hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports
And all they
ever did was complain
It shivered its wings
What
it said into the phone
Yes, I passed on your message to Mr  Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now
He's on an intergalactic cruise
It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who  was angrily  trying  to  engage  its attention
The petulant tentacle
directed the angry person to look at the notice on  the  wall  to its left and not to interrupt an important phone call
Yes, said the insect, he is in his  office,  but  he's  on  an intergalactic  cruise
Thank you so much for calling
It slammed
down the phone
Read the notice, it said to the angry man  who  was  trying  to complain  about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of misinformation contained in the book
The Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  is  an  indispensable companion  to  all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex and confusing Universe, for though  it  cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least make the reassuring claim, that where it is inaccurate it  is  at least  definitely  inaccurate
In cases of major discrepancy it's
always reality that's got it wrong
This  was  the  gist  of  the  notice
It  said  The  Guide  is definitive
Reality is frequently inaccurate
This has led to some interesting consequences
For instance, when the  Editors  of the Guide were sued by the families of those who
had died as a result of taking the  entry  on  the  planet  Traal literally  (it said Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists instead of Ravenous  Bugblatter beasts  often  make  a very good meal of visiting tourists) they claimed that the first version  of  the  sentence  was  the  more aesthetically  pleasing,  summoned  a  qualified  poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped  thereby to  prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true
The judges concurred, and in  a  moving
speech  held  that Life itself was in contempt of court, and duly confiscated it from all those there present before going  off  to enjoy a pleasant evening's ultragolf
Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer
He strode up to  the  insect receptionist
OK, he said, Where's Zarniwoop
Get me Zarniwoop
Excuse me, sir
said the insect icily
It did not  care  to  be addressed in this manner
Zarniwoop
Get him, right
Get him now
Well, sir, snapped the fragile little creature, if  you  could be a little cool about it
Look, said Zaphod, I'm up  to  here  with  cool,  OK
I'm  so amazingly  cool  you  could  keep  a side of meat inside me for a
month
I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my  pelvis
Now will you move before you blow it
Well, if you'd let me explain, sir, said the insect tapping the most  petulant  of all the tentacles at its disposal, I'm afraid that  isn't  possible  right  now  as  Mr  Zarniwoop  is  on   an intergalactic cruise
Hell, thought Zaphod
When he's going to be back
he said
Back sir
He's in his office
Zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought  out in his mind
He didn't succeed
This cat's on an intergalactic cruise
in  his  office
He leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle
Listen, three eyes, he said, don't you try to outweird  me
I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal
Well, just who do you think you are, honey
flounced the insect quivering its wings in rage, Zaphod Beeblebrox or something
Count the heads, said Zaphod in a low rasp
The insect blinked at him
It blinked at him again
You are Zaphod Beeblebrox
it squeaked
Yeah, said Zaphod, but don't shout it out or they'll all  want one
The Zaphod Beeblebrox
No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn't you  hear  I  come  in  six packs
The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation
But sir, it squealed, I just  heard  on  the  sub-ether  radio report
It said that you were dead
Yeah, that's right, said Zaphod, I just haven't stopped moving yet
Now
Where do I find Zarniwoop
Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but
But he's on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to him
The newly  installed  Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Vertical People Transporters are in the far corner sir
But sir
Zaphod was turning to go
He turned back
Yeah
he said
Can I ask you why you want to see Mr Zarniwoop
Yeah, said Zaphod, who was unclear on this  point  himself,  I told myself I had to
Come again sir
Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally
I just materialized out of thin air in one of  your  cafes,  he said,  as  a  result  of  an argument with the ghost of my great grandfather
No sooner had I got there that my former  self,  the
one  that  operated on my brain, popped into my head and said `Go see Zarniwoop'
I have never heard of the  cat
That  is  all  I
know
That  and the fact that I've got to find the man who rules the Universe
He winked
Mr Beeblebrox, sir, said the insect in awed wonder, you're  so weird you should be in movies
Yeah, said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink  wing, and you, baby, should be in real life
The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation  and then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone
A metal hand restrained it
Excuse me, said the owner of the metal hand  in  a  voice  that would  have  made  an  insect  of  a more sentimental disposition collapse in tears
This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots
Yes, sir, it snapped, can I help you
I doubt it, said Marvin
Well in that case, if you'll just excuse  me
Six  of  the phones  were  now  ringing
A million things awaited the insect's
attention
No one can help me, intoned Marvin
Yes, sir, well
Not that anyone tried of course
The  restraining  metal  hand fell  limply  by  Marvin's  side
His  head  hung  forward  very
slightly
Is that so, said the insect tartly
Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot is it
I'm sorry, sir, if
I mean where's the percentage in being  kind  or  helpful  to  a robot if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits
And you don't have any
said the insect, who didn't seem to  be able to drag itself out of this conversation
I've never had occasion to find out, Marvin informed it
Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal
Aren't you going to ask me what I want
The insect paused
Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its eyes and darted back again
Is it worth it
it asked
Is anything
said Marvin immediately
What
do
you
want
I'm looking for someone
Who
hissed the insect
Zaphod Beeblebrox, said Marvin, he's over there
The insect shook with rage
It could hardly speak
Then why did you ask me
it screamed
I just wanted something to talk to, said Marvin
What
Pathetic isn't it
With a grinding of gears  Marvin  turned  and  trundled  off
He caught  up  with  Zaphod  approaching  the elevators
Zaphod span
round in astonishment
Hey
Marvin
he said, Marvin
How did you get here
Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him
I don't know, he said
But
One moment I was sitting in your ship  feeling  very  depressed, and   the  next  moment  I  was  standing  here  feeling  utterly miserable
An Improbability Field I expect
Yeah, said Zaphod, I expect  my  great  grandfather  sent  you along to keep me company
Thanks a bundle grandad, he added to himself under his breath
So, how are you
he said aloud
Oh, fine, said Marvin, if you happen to like  being  me  which personally I don't
Yeah, yeah, said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened
Hello, said the elevator sweetly, I am to be your elevator for this  trip  to  the floor of your choice
I have been designed by
the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you,  the  visitor  to the  Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices
If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have recently been installed  in  the  offices  of  the  Galactic  tax department,  Boobiloo  Baby  Foods  and  the  Sirian State Mental Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives will  be  delighted  to  welcome your visits, sympathy, and happy tales of the outside world
Yeah, said Zaphod, stepping into  it,  what  else  do  you  do besides talk
I go up, said the elevator, or down
Good, said Zaphod, We're going up
Or down, the elevator reminded him
Yeah, OK, up please
There was a moment of silence
Down's very nice, suggested the elevator hopefully
Oh yeah
Super
Good, said Zaphod, Now will you take us up
May I ask you, inquired the  elevator  in  its  sweetest,  most reasonable  voice,  if  you've  considered all the possibilities that down might offer you
Zaphod knocked one of his  heads  against  the  inside  wall
He didn't  need  this,  he thought to himself, this of all things he
had no need of
He hadn't asked to be here
If he  was  asked  at this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said
he would like to be lying  on  the  beach  with  at  least  fifty beautiful  women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply
To this  he
would  probably have added something passionate on the subject of food
One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing  after  the  man who  ruled  the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at, because if  it  wasn't  him  it  would  only  be someone  else
Most  of  all he didn't want to be standing in an
office block arguing with an elevator
Like what other possibilities
he asked wearily
Well, the voice trickled on like honey  on  biscuits,  there's the basement, the microfiles, the heating system
er
It paused
Nothing particularly  exciting,  it  admitted,  but  they  are alternatives
Holy Zarquon, muttered Zaphod, did I ask for an existentialist elevator
he beat his fists against the wall
What's the matter with the thing
he spat
It doesn't want to go up, said Marvin  simply,  I  think  it's afraid
Afraid
cried Zaphod, Of what
Heights
An  elevator  that's afraid of heights
No, said the elevator miserably, of the future
The future
exclaimed Zaphod, What  does  the  wretched  thing want, a pension scheme
At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind them
From  the  walls  around  them  came the sound of suddenly
active machinery
We can all see into the future, whispered the elevator in  what sounded like terror, it's part of our programming
Zaphod looked out  of  the  elevator  -  an  agitated  crowd  had gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting
Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast
He ducked back in
Marvin, he said, just get this elevator go up will you
We've got to get to Zarniwoop
Why
asked Marvin dolefully
I don't know, said Zaphod, but when I find  him,  he'd  better have a very good reason for me wanting to see him
Modern elevators are strange and complex  entities
The  ancient electric  winch and maximum-capacity-eight-persons jobs bear as
much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy  Vertical People  Transporter  as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital
This  is  because  they  operate  on  the  curios  principle   of defocused  temporal  perception
In  other words they have the
capacity to see dimly into the immediate  future,  which  enables the  elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before you  knew  you  wanted  it,  thus  eliminating  all  the  tedious chatting,   relaxing,   and   making  friends  that  people  were previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators
Not unnaturally, many  elevators  imbued  with  intelligence  and precognition   became   terribly  frustrated  with  the  mindless business of going up and down, up and down, experimented  briefly with  the  notion  of  going  sideways,  as a sort of existential protest, demanded participation in  the  decision-making  process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking
An impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets  in  the  Sirius star  system  these  days  can  pick  up  easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators
At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly
Fifteenth, said the elevator, and  remember,  I'm  only  doing this because I like your robot
Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of  the  elevator  which  instantly snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would take it
Zaphod looked around warily
The corridor was deserted and silent and  gave  no  clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found
All the
doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked
They were standing close to the bridge which led across from  one tower  of  the  building to the other
Through a large window the
brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light  in  which danced small specks of dust
A shadow flitted past momentarily
Left in the lurch by a lift, muttered Zaphod, who  was  feeling at his least jaunty
They both stood and looked in both directions
You know something
said Zaphod to Marvin
More that you can possibly imagine
I'm dead certain this building  shouldn't  be  shaking,  Zaphod said
It was just a light tremor through the soles of his  feet  -  and another  one
In  the  sunbeams  the  flecks of dust danced more
vigorously
Another shadow flitted past
Zaphod looked at the floor
Either, he said, not very confidently, they've got some  vibro system for toning up your muscles while you work, or
He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled  because  at that  moment  his  Joo  Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black
A large shadow flitted  past
the window with a sharp buzz
Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so  the  building shook with a thunderous roar
He leapt to the window
Or, he said, this building's being bombed
Another roar cracked through the building
Who in the Galaxy would want  to  bomb  a  publishing  company
asked  Zaphod,  but  never  heard  Marvin's reply because at that moment the building shook with another bomb attack
He  tried  to
stagger back to the elevator - a pointless manoeuvre he realized, but the only one he could think of
Suddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from this  one,  he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a man
The man saw him
Beeblebrox, over here
he shouted
Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb  blast  rocked  the building
No, called Zaphod, Beeblebrox over here
Who are you
A friend
shouted back the man
He ran towards Zaphod
Oh yeah
said Zaphod, Anyone's friend in particular,  or  just generally well disposed of people
The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking  beneath  his feet   like   an  excited  blanket
He  was  short,  stocky  and
weatherbeaten and his clothes looked  as  if  they'd  been  twice round the Galaxy and back with him in them
Do you know, Zaphod shouted in his ear when he  arrived,  your building's being bombed
The man indicated his awareness
It suddenly stopped being light
Glancing round at the window  to see   why,  Zaphod  gaped  as  a  huge  sluglike,  gunmetal-green
spacecraft crept through the air  past  the  building
Two  more followed it
The government you deserted is out to get you,  Zaphod,  hissed the man, they've sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters
Frogstar Fighters
muttered Zaphod, Zarquon
You get the picture
What are Frogstar Fighters
Zaphod was sure he'd heard  someone talk  about  them  when  he was President, but he never paid much
attention to official matters
The man was pulling him back through a door
He  went  with  him
With  a  searing  whine  a  small  black  spider-like object shot through the air and disappeared down the corridor
What was that
hissed Zaphod
Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you, said the man
Hey yeah
Get down
From the opposite  direction  came  a  larger  black  spider-like object
It zapped past them
And that was
A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you
And that
said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air
A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you
Hey, chuckled Zaphod to himself, pretty stupid robots eh
From over the bridge came a  massive  rumbling  hum
A  gigantic black  shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size
and shape of a tank
Holy photon, what's that
A tank, said the man, Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get you
Should we leave
I think we should
Marvin
called Zaphod
What do you want
Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the  corridor  and looked at them
You see that robot coming towards us
Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward  towards them over the bridge
He looked down at his own small metal body
He looked back up at the tank
I suppose you want me to stop it, he said
Yeah
Whilst you save your skins
Yeah, said Zaphod, get in there
Just so long, said Marvin, as I know where I stand
The man tugged at Zaphod's arm, and Zaphod followed him off  down the corridor
A point occurred to him about this
Where are we going
he said
Zarniwoop's office
Is this any time to keep an appointment
Come on
Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor
He  was  not  in fact  a  particularly small robot
His silver body gleamed in the
dusty sunbeams and shook with the  continual  barrage  which  the building was still undergoing
He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black  tank rolled  to  a  halt in front of him
The tank examined him with a
probe
The probe withdrew
Marvin stood there
Out of my way little robot, growled the tank
I'm afraid, said Marvin, that I've  been  left  here  to  stop you
The probe extended again for a quick recheck
It withdrew again
You
Stop me
roared the tank
Go on
No, really I have, said Marvin simply
What are you armed with
roared the tank in disbelief
Guess, said Marvin
The tank's engines  rumbled,  its  gears  ground
Molecule-sized electronic  relays  deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and
forwards in consternation
Guess
said the tank
Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second  and  along  a  third
The building continued to rock and
judder and this puzzled  Zaphod
If  they  wanted  to  blow  the building up, why was it taking so long
With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous unmarked doors and heaved at it
With a sudden jolt it opened and
they fell inside
All this way, thought Zaphod, all this  trouble,  all  this  not- lying-on-the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time,   and   for  what
A
single chair, a single desk and a  single  dirty  ashtray  in  an undecorated  office
The  desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust
and single, revolutionary form of paper clip, was empty
Where, said Zaphod, is Zarniwoop
feeling  that  his  already tenuous  grasp  of the point of this whole exercise was beginning
to slip
He's on an intergalactic cruise, said the man
Zaphod tried to size the man up
Earnest type, he thought, not  a barrel  of  laughs
He  probably apportioned a fair whack of his
time to running up and  down  heaving  corridors,  breaking  down doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices
Let me introduce myself, the man said, My name is Roosta,  and this is my towel
Hello Roosta, said Zaphod
Hello, towel, he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty old flowery towel
Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by
the corner
Outside the window, one of  the  huge  slug-like,  gunmetal-green spaceships growled past
Yes, go on, said Marvin to the  huge  battle  machine,  you'll never guess
Errmmm
said  the  machine,  vibrating  with  unaccustomed thought, laser beams
Marvin shook his head solemnly
No, muttered the machine in  its  deep  guttural  rumble,  Too obvious
Anti-matter ray
it hazarded
Far too obvious, admonished Marvin
Yes, grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, Er
how  about an electron ram
This was new to Marvin
What's that
he said
One of these, said the machine with enthusiasm
From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single  lethal blaze  of  light
Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a
heap of dust
The dust billowed briefly, then settled
No, said Marvin, not one of those
Good though, isn't it
Very good, agreed Marvin
I  know,  said  the  Frogstar  battle  machine,  after  another moment's  consideration,  you must have one of those new Xanthic Re-Structron Destabilized Zenon Emitters
Nice, aren't they
said Marvin
That's what you've got
said the machine in considerable awe
No, said Marvin
Oh, said the machine, disappointed, then it must be
You're thinking along the wrong  lines,  said  Marvin,  You're failing  to  take  into  account  something  fairly  basic in the relationship between men and robots
Er, I know, said the battle machine, is it
it tailed  off into thought again
Just think, urged Marvin, they left me,  an  ordinary,  menial robot,  to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst they ran off to save themselves
What do  you  think  they  would
leave me with
Oooh, er, muttered the machine in alarm, something pretty damn devastating I should expect
Expect
said Marvin, oh yes, expect
I'll tell you  what  they gave me to protect myself with shall I@
Yes, alright, said the battle machine, bracing itself
Nothing, said Marvin
There was a dangerous pause
Nothing
roared the battle machine
Nothing at all, intoned Marvin  dismally,  not  an  electronic sausage
The machine heaved about with fury
Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit
it roared,  Nothing, eh
Just don't think, do they
And me, said Marvin in a soft low voice,  with  this  terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side
Makes you spit, doesn't it
Yes, agreed Marvin with feeling
Hell that makes me angry, bellowed  the  machine,  think  I'll smash that wall down
The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of  light  and took out the wall next to the machine
How do you think I feel
said Marvin bitterly
Just ran off and left you, did they
the machine thundered
Yes, said Marvin
I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well
raged the tank
It took out the ceiling of the bridge
That's very impressive, murmured Marvin
You ain't seeing nothing yet, promised the machine, I can take out this floor too, no trouble
It took out the floor, too
Hell's bells
the  machine  roared  as  it  plummeted  fifteen storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below
What a depressingly stupid machine,  said  Marvin  and  trudged away
So, do we just sit here, or what
said Zaphod angrily, what do these guys out here want
You, Beeblebrox, said Roosta, they're going to take you to the Frogstar - the most totally evil world in the Galaxy
Oh, yeah
said Zaphod
They'll have to come and get me first
They have come and got you,  said  Roosta,  look  out  of  the window
Zaphod looked, and gaped
The ground's going away
he gasped, where are they taking  the ground
They're taking the building, said Roosta, we're airborne
Clouds streaked past the office window
Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green Frogstar  Fighters  round  the  uprooted tower of the building
A
network of force beams radiated in from them and held  the  tower in a firm grip
Zaphod shook his head in perplexity
What have I done to deserve this
he  said,  I  walk  into  a building, they take it away
It's not what you've done they're worried about,  said  Roosta, it's what you're going to do
Well don't I get a say in that
You did, years ago
You'd better hold on, we're in  for  a  fast and bumpy journey
If I ever meet myself, said Zaphod, I'll hit myself so hard  I won't know what's hit me
Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod  accusingly, slumped in a corner and switched himself off
On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent
Arthur stared at  the  rack  in  front of him and thought
He caught Trillian's
eyes as she looked at him inquiringly
He  looked  back  at  the rack
Finally he saw it
He picked up five small plastic squares  and  laid  them  on  the board that lay just in front of the rack
The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U  and  I
He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E
Exquisite, he said, on a triple word score
Scores  rather  a lot I'm afraid
The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for  the  'n'th time
Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again
Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he stalked the ship thumping dead instruments
Why did the ship keep shaking
he thought
Why did it rock and sway
Why could he not find out where they were
Where, basically, were they
The left-hand tower of the Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy offices  streaked  through  interstellar  space  at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in  the Universe
In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily
Roosta sat on the edge of  the  desk  doing  some  routine  towel maintenance
Hey, where did you say this building was  flying  to
demanded Zaphod
The Frogstar, said Roosta, the most totally evil place in  the Universe
Do they have food there
said Zaphod
Food
You're going to the  Frogstar  and  you're  worried  about whether they got food
Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar
Out of the window, they could  see  nothing  but  the  flickering light  of  the  force  beams,  and vague green streaks which were presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters
At this
speed, space itself was invisible, and indeed unreal
Here, suck this, said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel
Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to  leap  out  of his forehead on a small spring
It's soaked in nutrients, explained Roosta
What are you, a messy eater or something
said Zaphod
The yellow stripes are high in  protein,  the  green  ones  have vitamin  B  and  C  complexes,  the  little  pink flowers contain wheatgerm extracts
Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement
What are the brown stains
he asked
Bar-B-Q sauce, said Roosta, for when I get sick of wheatgerm
Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully
Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner
He spat it out again
Ugh, he stated
Yes, said Roosta, when I've had to suck  that  end  I  usually need to suck the other end a bit too
Why, asked Zaphod suspiciously, what's in that
Anti-depressants, said Roosta
I've gone right off this towel, you know, said  Zaphod  handing it back
Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk,  walked round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up
Beeblebrox, he said, sticking his hands behind his head,  have you any idea what's going to happen to you on the Frogstar
They're going to feed me
hazarded Zaphod hopefully
They're going  to  feed  you,  said  Roosta,  into  the  Total Perspective Vortex
Zaphod had never heard of this
He believed that he had heard  of all  the  fun  things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total
Perspective Vortex was not fun
He asked what it was
Only, said Roosta, the most savage psychic torture a sentinent being can undergo
Zaphod nodded a resigned nod
So, he said, no food, huh
Listen
said Roosta urgently, you can kill a man, destroy  his body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can
annihilate a man's soul
The treatment  lasts  seconds,  but  the effect lasts the rest of your life
You ever had  a  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster
asked  Zaphod sharply
This is worse
Phreeow
admitted Zaphod, much impressed
Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me
he added a moment later
They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever
They know what you're after
Could they drop me a note and let me know as well
You know, said Roosta, you know, Beeblebrox
You want to  meet the man who rules the Universe
Can he cook
said Zaphod
On reflection he added: I doubt if he can
If he could cook  a  good  meal  he  wouldn't
worry about the rest of the Universe
I want to meet a cook
Roosta sighed heavily
What are you doing here anyway
demanded  Zaphod,  what's  all this got to so with you
I'm just one  of  those  who  planned  this  thing,  along  with Zarniwoop,  along  with  Yooden  Vranx,  along  with  your  great grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox
Me
Yes, you
I was told you  had  changed,  I  didn't  realize  how much
But
I am here to do one job
I will do it before I leave you
What job, man, what are you talking about
I will do it before I leave you
Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence
Zaphod was terribly glad
The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale and unwholesome
The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over salt  flats,  dried  up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation and the crumbling remains of ruined cities
No life moved  across
its  surface
The ground, like that of many planets in this part of the Galaxy, had long been deserted
The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old  decaying  houses  of  the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped about the bottoms of the tall black  towers  that  swayed uneasily  here  and there about the surface of this world
At the
top of these  towers  lived  colonies  of  large,  scraggy,  evil smelling  birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once lived here
The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however,  when  it passed  over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities
This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned  this  world the  reputation  of  being  the  most  totally  evil place in the Galaxy
From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet
across
From within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend
About a hundred yards or so away, and  separated  from  it  by  a pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad  of sorts
That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the
ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings
Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind  that was waiting for something
The mind directed its attention into the  air,  and  before  very long  a  distant  speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks
The larger speck was the left-hand tower  of  the  Hitch  Hiker's Guide  to  the  Galaxy  office  building,  descending through the stratosphere of Frogstar World B
As it descended, Roosta suddenly  broke  the  long  uncomfortable silence that had grown up between the two men
He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag
He said: Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do
Zaphod looked up at him from where he was  sitting  in  a  corner sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin
Yeah
he said
The building  will  shortly  be  landing
When  you  leave  the building, do not go out of the door, said Roosta, go out of the
window
Good luck, he added, and walked out of the  door,  disappearing from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it
Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already looked it
He shrugged and returned to the corner
Two minutes later, the building  crashlanded  amongst  the  other wreckage
Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force
beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World A,  an  altogether  more  congenial  spot
They  never landed on
Frogstar World B
No one did
No one ever walked on  its  surface other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex
Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash
He lay for a while  in  the silent  dusty  rubble to which most of the room had been reduced
He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in  his life
He  felt  bewildered,  he  felt  lonely,  he felt unloved
Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with
He looked around the cracked and broken room
The wall had  split round the door frame, and the door hung open
The window, by some
miracle was closed and unbroken
For a while he  hesitated,  then he  thought  that  if  his  strange and recent companion had been
through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told  him, then there must be a good reason for it
With Marvin's
help he got the window  open
Outside  it,  the  cloud  of  dust aroused  by  the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with
which this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod  from seeing anything of the world outside
Not that this concerned him unduly
His main concern was what  he saw  when he looked down
Zarniwoop's office was on the fifteenth
floor
The building had landed at  a  tilt  of  about  forty-five degrees, but still the descent looked heart-stopping
Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous  looks that  Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and clambered out on to the steeply inclined side  of  the  building
Marvin  followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully down the fifteen floors that separated  them  from  the ground
As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs,  his  eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin
The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of  This  is  the sort  of  thing  you  lifeforms  enjoy  is  it
I ask merely for
information, did little to improve his state of mind
About half-way down the  side  of  the  shattered  building  they stopped to rest
It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with
fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful  than usual
Eventually  he  realized  this  wasn't so
The robot just
seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood
A large, scraggy black bird  came  flapping  through  the  slowly settling  clouds  of  dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod
It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch
Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head and  neck  seemed  curiously large for a bird
Its face was flat,
the beak underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of  its wings the vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen
In fact, it looked almost human
It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and  clicked  its  beak  in  a desultory fashion
Go away, said Zaphod
OK, muttered the bird morosely and flapped off  into  the  dust again
Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment
Did that bird just talk to me
he asked  Marvin  nervously
He was  quite  prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that
he was in fact hallucinating
Yes, confirmed Marvin
Poor souls, said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear
Twisting round violently to find the source of the  voice  nearly caused  Zaphod to fall off the building
He grabbed savagely at a
protruding window fitting and cut his hand on  it
He  hung  on, breathing heavily
The voice had no visible source  whatever  -  there  was  no  one there
Nevertheless, it spoke again
A tragic history behind them, you know
A terrible blight
Zaphod looked wildly about
The voice  was  deep  and  quiet
In other circumstances it would even be described as soothing
There
is,  however,  nothing  soothing  about  being  addressed  by   a disembodied  voice  out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best  and  hanging  from  a  ledge eight storeys up a crashed building
Hey, er
he stammered
Shall I tell you their story
inquired the voice quietly
Hey, who are you
panted Zaphod
Where are you
Later then, perhaps, murmured the voice
I am Gargravarr
I am the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex
Why can't I see
You  will  find  your  progress  down   the   building   greatly facilitated,  the  voice lifted, if you move about two yards to your left
Why don't you try it
Zaphod looked and  saw  a  series  of  short  horizontal  grooves leading  all the way down the side of the building
Gratefully he
shifted himself across to them
Why don't I see you again at the bottom
said the voice in  his ear, and as it spoke it faded
Hey, called out Zaphod, Where are you
It'll only take a couple of minutes
said  the  voice  very faintly
Marvin, said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to him, Did a
did a voice just
Yes, Marvin replied tersely
Zaphod nodded
He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses  again
They  were  completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by the unexpected metal object in his pocket
He  put  them  on
He
would  find  his  way  down  the  building more comfortably if he didn't actually have to look at what he was doing
Minutes  later  he  clambered  over  the   ripped   and   mangled foundations   of   the  building  and,  once  more  removing  his sunglasses, he dropped to the ground
Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down  in  the dust and rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to move
Ah, there you are, said the voice  suddenly  in  Zaphod's  ear, excuse  me  leaving  you  like  that,  it's  just  that I have a terrible head for heights
At least, it added wistfully, I  did
have a terrible head for heights
Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he  had missed  something  which might be the source of the voice
All he
saw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks  of the encircling buildings
Hey, er, why can't I see you
he said, why aren't you here
I am here, said the voice slowly, my body wanted to  come  but it's  a  bit  busy  at  the moment
Things to do, people to see
After what seemed like a sort of ethereal  sigh  it  added,  You know how it is with bodies
Zaphod wasn't sure about this
I thought I did, he said
I only hope it's gone for a rest  cure,  continued  the  voice, the  way  it's  been  living  recently  it  must  be on its last elbows
Elbows
said Zaphod, don't you mean last legs
The  voice  said  nothing  for  a  while
Zaphod  looked  around uneasily
He  didn't  know  if it was gone or was still there or
what it was doing
Then the voice spoke again
So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes
Er, well, said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at  nonchalance, this  cat's  in  no hurry, you know
I can just slouch about and
take in a look at the local scenery, you know
Have you seen the local scenery
asked the voice of Gargravarr
Er, no
Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner  of  one of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view
He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B
Ah, OK, he said, I'll just sort of slouch about then
No, said Gargravarr, the Vortex is ready for you now
You must come
Follow me
Er, yeah
said Zaphod, and how am I meant to do that
I'll hum for you, said Gargravarr, follow the humming
A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale,  sad  sound that  seemed  to  be  without  any  kind of focus
It was only by
listening very carefully that  Zaphod  was  able  to  detect  the direction  from which it was coming
Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled
off in its wake
What else was there to do
The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore
Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their  own devising, and this is what most beings in fact do
For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies  the large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire intelligent population of which lives permanently in one fairly small  and  crowded  nut tree
In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny
speculative articles in the bark on  the  meaning  of  life,  the futility  of  death  and the importance of birth control, fight a few extremely minor wars, and  eventually  die  strapped  to  the underside of some of the less accessible outer branches
In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who  are  hurled  out  of  it  for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the other trees might  be  capable  of  supporting life at all, or indeed whether the other trees are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts
Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life  form  in the  Galaxy  which  is  not in some way guilty of the same thing, which is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as  horrific  as  it is
For when you are put into the  Vortex  you  are  given  just  one momentary   glimpse   of  the  entire  unimaginable  infinity  of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says You are here
The grey plain  stretched  before  Zaphod,  a  ruined,  shattered plain
The wind whipped wildly over it
Visible in the middle was the steel pimple  of  the  dome
This, gathered  Zaphod,  was  where  he  was  going
This was the Total
Perspective Vortex
As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a  sudden  inhuman  wail  of terror  emanated  from  it as of a man having his soul burnt from his body
It screamed above the wind and died away
Zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn  to  liquid helium
Hey, what was that
he muttered voicelessly
A recording, said Gargravarr, of the last man who was  put  in the  Vortex
It  is  always played to the next victim
A sort of
prelude
Hey, it really sounds bad
stammered  Zaphod,  couldn't  we maybe  slope  off  to  a party or something for a while, think it
over
For all I know, said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, I'm probably at  one
My body that is
It goes to a lot of parties without me
Says I only get in the way
Hey ho
What is all this with your body
said Zaphod, anxious to  delay whatever it was that was going to happen to him
Well, it's
it's busy you know, said Gargravarr hesitantly
You mean it's got a mind of its own
said Zaphod
There was a long and  slightly  chilly  pause  before  Gargravarr spoke again
I have to say, he replied eventually, that I find that  remark in rather poor taste
Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology
No matter, said Gargravarr, you weren't to know
The voice fluttered unhappily
The truth is, it continued in  tones  which  suggested  he  was trying  very hard to keep it under control, the truth is that we are currently undergoing a period of legal  trial  separation
I
suspect it will end in divorce
The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to say
He mumbled uncertainly
I think we are probably not very well suited,  said  Gargravarr again  at  length,  we  never  seemed to be happy doing the same things
We  always  had  the  greatest  arguments  over  sex  and
fishing
Eventually  we  tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine
And  now  my  body
refuses to let me in
It won't even see me
He paused again, tragically
The wind whipped across the plain
It says I only inhibit it
I pointed out  that  in  fact  I  was meant  to  inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort
of smart alec remark that got right up a body's left nostril, and so we left it
It will probably get custody of my forename
Oh
said Zaphod faintly, and what's that
Pizpot, said the voice, My name is Pizpot Gargravarr
Says  it all really doesn't it
Errr
said Zaphod sympathetically
And that is why  I,  as  a  disembodied  mind,  have  this  job, Custodian  of the Total Perspective Vortex
No one will ever walk
on the ground of this planet
Except the victims of the Vortex  - they don't really count I'm afraid
Ah
I'll tell you the story
Would you like to hear it
Er
Many years ago this was  a  thriving,  happy  planet  -  people, cities  shops, a normal world
Except that on the high streets of
these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than  one  might have  thought  necessary
And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of
these shoe shops were increasing
It's  a  well  known  economic phenomenon  but  tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe
shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and  the  worse and more unwearable they became
And the worse they were to wear,
the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the  more the  shops  proliferated,  until  the  whole economy of the place passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event  Horizon,  and  it became  no  longer  economically possible to build anything other than shoe shops
Result - collapse, ruin and famine
Most of  the
population  died out
Those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds - you've seen one of  them  -  who
cursed  their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should walk on it again
Unhappy lot
Come,  I  must  take  you  to  the
Vortex
Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled  forward  across the plain
And you, he said, you come from this hellhole pit do you
No no, said Gargravarr, taken aback, I come from the  Frogstar World C
Beautiful place
Wonderful fishing
I flit back there in
the evenings
Though all  I  can  do  now  is  watch
The  Total Perspective  Vortex  is  the  only  thing on this planet with any
function
It was built here because no  one  else  wanted  it  on their doorstep
At that moment another dismal scream  rent  the  air  and  Zaphod shuddered
What can do that to a guy
he breathed
The Universe,  said  Gargravarr  simply,  the  whole  infinite Universe
The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them,
and yourself an invisible dot on  an  invisible  dot,  infinitely small
Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox,  man,  you  know,  muttered  Zaphod trying to flap the last remnants of his ego
Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming till  they  reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain
As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side,  revealing  a small darkened chamber within
Enter, said Gargravarr
Zaphod started with fear
Hey, what, now
he said
Now
Zaphod peered nervously inside
The chamber was  very  small
It was  steel-lined  and  there was hardly space in it for more than
one man
It
er
it doesn't look like any kind of  Vortex  to  me, said Zaphod
It isn't, said Gargravarr, it's just the elevator
Enter
With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it
He was aware of Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied
man was not for the moment speaking
The elevator began its descent
I must get myself into  the  right  frame  of  mind  for  this, muttered Zaphod
There is no right frame of mind, said Gargravarr sternly
You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate
I don't
The Vortex does
At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the  elevator  opened  up and  Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined chamber
At the far side of it stood a  single  upright  steel  box,  just large enough for a man to stand in
It was that simple
It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via  a single thick wire
Is that it
said Zaphod in surprise
That is it
Didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod
And I get in there do I
said Zaphod
You get in there, said Gargravarr, and I'm afraid you must  do it now
OK, OK, said Zaphod
He opened the door of the box and stepped in
Inside the box he waited
After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was there in the box with him
The Total Perspective Vortex derives its  picture  of  the  whole Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses
To explain - since every piece of matter in the  Universe  is  in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of  creation  - every  sun,  every  planet,  their  orbits, their composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small  piece  of fairy cake
The  man  who  invented  the  Total  Perspective  Vortex  did  so basically in order to annoy his wife
Trin Tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a  thinker, a  speculative  philosopher  or,  as  his  wife would have it, an idiot
And she would nag him incessantly about  the  utterly  inordinate amount  of  time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake
Have some sense of proportion
she  would  say,  sometimes  as often as thirty-eight times in a single day
And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show her
And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as  extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: so that when he turned it on she saw  in  one  instant  the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it
To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock  completely  annihilated  her brain;  but  to  his  satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size,  then  the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion
The door of the Vortex swung open
From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly
He  had rather  liked  Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way
He was
clearly a man of many qualities, even if  they  were  mostly  bad ones
He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box,  as  they  all did
Instead, he stepped out
Hi
he said
Beeblebrox
gasped Gargravarr's mind in amazement
Could I have a drink please
said Zaphod
You
you
have been in the Vortex
stammered Gargravarr
You saw me, kid
And it was working
Sure was
And you saw the whole infinity of creation
Sure
Really neat place, you know that
Gargravarr's mind was reeling in astonishment
Had his body  been with  him  it  would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging
open
And you saw yourself, said Gargravarr, in relation to it all
Oh, yeah, yeah
But
what did you experience
Zaphod shrugged smugly
It just told me what I knew all the time
I'm a really  terrific and great guy
Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox
His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the  vortex  and suddenly stopped, startled
He breathed heavily
Hey, he said, is that really a piece of fairy cake
He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors  with which it was surrounded
If I told you how much I needed this, he  said  ravenously,  I wouldn't have time to eat it
He ate it
A short while later he was  running  across  the  plain  in  the direction of the ruined city
The dank air wheezed heavily  in  his  lungs  and  he  frequently stumbled  with  the  exhaustion  he  was still feeling
Night was
beginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous
The elation of his recent experience was still with  him  though
The  whole Universe
He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity around him - everything
And with it had come the  clear
and  extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it
Having a conceited ego is one thing
Actually  being  told
by a machine is another
He didn't have time to reflect on this matter
Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert  his  masters as  to  what  had  happened,  but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing so
Enough time for Zaphod to make a
break and find somewhere to hide
What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that  he  was the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence to believe that something would turn up
Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much  grounds for optimism
He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city
He walked along cracked and gaping  roads  riddled  with  scrawny weeds,  the  holes  filled  with  rotting shoes
The buildings he
passed were so crumbled and decrepit  he  thought  it  unsafe  to enter any of them
Where could he hide
He hurried on
After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road  led  off  from the  one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building,  surrounded  with  sundry  smaller  ones,   the   whole surrounded  by the remains of a perimeter barrier
The large main
building still seemed reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off  to see if it might provide him with
well with anything
He approached the building
Along one side of it - the  front  it would  seem  since  it  faced  a wide concreted apron area - were
three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high
The far one of these was open, and towards this, Zaphod ran
Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion
Giant cobwebs lay over everything
Part  of  the  infrastructure  of  the  building had
collapsed, part of the rear  wall  had  caved  in,  and  a  thick choking dust lay inches over the floor
Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris
The  shapes  were  sometimes  cylindrical,   sometimes   bulbous, sometimes  like  eggs,  or rather cracked eggs
Most of them were
split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons
They were all spacecraft, all derelict
Zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks
There was nothing here  that  remotely  approached  the  serviceable
Even the mere
vibration  of  his  footsteps  caused  one  precarious  wreck  to collapse further into itself
Towards the rear of the  building  lay  one  old  ship,  slightly larger  than  the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs
Its outline, however, seemed  unbroken
Zaphod
approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an old feedline
He tried  to  toss  the  feedline  aside,  and  to  his  surprise discovered that it was still connected to the ship
To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was  also humming slightly
He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then  back  down  at  the feedline in his hands
He tore off his jacket and threw it aside
Crawling along on  his hands  and  knees  he followed the feedline to the point where it
connected with the ship
The connection was sound, and the slight humming vibration was more distinct
His heart was beating fast
He wiped away some grime and laid  an ear  against  the  ship's  side
He  could  only  hear  a faint,
indeterminate noise
He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor  all about  him  and  found  a  short  length  of  tubing,  and a non- biodegradable plastic cup
Out  of  this  he  fashioned  a  crude
stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship
What he heard made his brains turn somersaults
The voice said: Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize  to  passengers for  the  continuing  delay  to  this  flight
We  are currently
awaiting the loading of  our  complement  of  small  lemon-soaked paper  napkins  for  your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during the journey
Meanwhile we thank you for your patience
The  cabin
crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again
Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship
He walked around for a few moments in a  daze
In  so  doing  he suddenly  caught  sight of a giant departure board still hanging,
but by only one support, from  the  ceiling  above  him
It  was covered   with   grime,  but  some  of  the  figures  were  still
discernible
Zaphod's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some  brief calculations
His eyes widened
Nine hundred years
he breathed to  himself
That  was  how late the ship was
Two minutes later he was on board
As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that  greeted  him  was cool and fresh - the air conditioning was still working
The lights were still on
He moved out of the small entrance chamber into  a  short  narrow corridor and stepped nervously down it
Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him
Please return to your seat sir,  said  the  android  stewardess and,  turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in front of him
When his heart had started beating again  he  followed  her
She opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through
He followed her through the door
They were now in the passenger  compartment  and  Zaphod's  heart stopped still again for a moment
In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat
The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were long, the men wore beards
All of them were quite clearly alive - but sleeping
Zaphod had the creeping horrors
He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream
By the time he was half-way  down  the  aisle,  the stewardess had reached the other
end
She turned and spoke
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, she said  sweetly,  Thank you  for  bearing  with  us  during this slight delay
We will be
taking off as soon as we possibly can
If you would like to  wake up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits
There was a slight hum
At that moment, all the passengers awoke
They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support systems  that held them tightly in their seats
They screamed and
bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter
They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently  moved  up the  aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits in front of each one of them
Then one of them rose from his seat
He turned and looked at Zaphod
Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was  trying to get off
He turned and ran from the bedlam
He plunged through the door and back into the corridor
The man pursued him
He raced in a frenzy to the end  of  the  corridor,  through  the entrance  chamber  and  beyond
He  arrived  on the flight deck,
slammed and bolted the door behind him
He leant back against the door breathing hard
Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door
From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him
Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck
Please return  to your seat, and wait for the ship to take off
Coffee and biscuits
are being served
This is your autopilot speaking
Please  return to your seat
Zaphod said nothing
He  breathed  hard,  behind  him,  the  hand continued to knock on the door
Please return to your seat, repeated the autopilot
Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck
I'm not a passenger, panted Zaphod
Please return to your seat
I am not a passenger
shouted Zaphod again
Please return to your seat
I am not a
hello, can you hear me
Please return to your seat
You're the autopilot
said Zaphod
Yes, said the voice from the flight console
You're in charge of this ship
Yes, said the voice again, there has been a delay
Passengers are  to  be  kept  temporarily  in suspended animation, for their
comfort and convenience
Coffee and  biscuits  are  being  served every  year,  after  which  passengers  are returned to suspended
animation for their continued comfort and convenience
Departure will take place when the flight stores are complete
We apologize
for the delay
Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the  pounding  had  now ceased
He approached the flight console
Delay
he cried, Have you seen the world  outside  this  ship
It's  a  wasteland,  a desert
Civilization's been and gone, man
There  are  no  lemon-soaked  paper  napkins  on  the  way   from anywhere
The statistical likelihood, continued the autopilot primly, is that  other  civilizations  will  arise
There  will  one day be
lemon-soaked paper napkins
Till  then  there  will  be  a  short delay
Please return to your seat
But
But at that moment the door opened
Zaphod span round to see  the man  who  had  pursued  him  standing  there
He carried a large
briefcase
He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short
He had no beard and no long fingernails
Zaphod Beeblebrox, he said, My name is  Zarniwoop
I  believe you wanted to see me
Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered
His mouths said  foolish  things
He dropped into a chair
Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from
he said
I've been waiting here for you, he said in a businesslike tone
He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair
I am glad you followed instructions, he  said,  I  was  a  bit nervous  that  you  might  have left my office by the door rather than the window
Then you would have been in trouble
Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled
When  you  entered  the  door  of  my  office,  you  entered  my electronically  synthesized  Universe, he explained, if you had left by the door you would have been back in the  real  one
The
artificial one works from here
He patted the briefcase smugly
Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing
What's the difference
he muttered
Nothing, said Zarniwoop, they are identical
Oh - except  that I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe
What's going on
spat Zaphod
Simple, said Zarniwoop
His self assurance  and  smugness  made Zaphod seethe
Very simple, repeated Zarniwoop, I discovered the  coordinated at  which  this  man  could  be  found  -  the  man who rules the Universe, and discovered that  his  world  was  protected  by  an Unprobability  field
To  protect  my  secret  -  and myself - I
retreated to the safety of this totally artificial  Universe  and hid  myself  away  in  a  forgotten  cruise  liner
I was secure
Meanwhile, you and I
You and I
said Zaphod angrily, you mean I knew you
Yes, said Zarniwoop, we knew each other well
I had no taste, said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence
Meanwhile,  you  and  I  arranged  that  you  would  steal   the Improbability  Drive  ship  -  the only one which could reach the ruler's world - and bring it to me here
This you have now done I
trust,  and  I  congratulate you
He smiled a tight little smile which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick
Oh, and in case you  were  wondering,  added  Zarniwoop,  this Universe  was  created  specifically  for you to come to
You are
therefore the most important person in this Universe
You  would never, he said with an even more brickable smile, have survived
the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one
Shall we go
Where
said Zaphod sullenly
He felt collapsed
To your ship
The Heart of Gold
You did bring it I trust
No
Where is your jacket
Zaphod looked at him in mystification
My jacket
I took it off
It's outside
Good, we will go and find it
Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him
Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits
It has not been a pleasant experience  waiting  for  you,  said Zarniwoop
Not pleasant for you
bawled Zaphod, How do you think
Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung  open
A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod's jacket lying in the debris
A very remarkable  and  very  powerful  ship,  said  Zarniwoop, watch
As they watched, the pocket on the  jacket  suddenly  bulged
It split, it ripped
The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that
Zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing
It grew, it continued to grow
It reached, after two minutes, its full size
At an Improbability Level, said Zarniwoop, of
oh  I  don't know, but something very large
Zaphod swayed
You mean I had it with me all the time
Zarniwoop smiled
He lifted up his briefcase and opened it
He twisted a single switch inside it
Goodbye artificial Universe, he said, hello real one
The scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared  exactly as before
You see
said Zarniwoop, exactly the same
You mean, repeated Zaphod tautly, that I had it with  me  all the time
Oh yes, said Zarniwoop, of course
That was the whole point
That's it, said Zaphod, you can count me out, from  hereon  in you  can count me out
I've had all I want of this
You play your
own games
I'm afraid you cannot leave, said Zarniwoop, you are  entwined in the Improbability field
You cannot escape
He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and  this  time Zaphod hit it
Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold
Trillian
Arthur
he  shouted,  it's  working
The   ship's reactivated
Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor
Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off, he  said  kicking them awake
Hi there guys
twittered the computer, it's really great to be back  with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that
Shut up, said Ford, tell us where the hell we are
Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump, said Zaphod  running  on to the bridge, hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am
What a what
said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from  the floor and not taking any of this in
I know how you feel, said Zaphod, I'm  so  great  even  I  get tongue-tied talking to myself
Hey it's good to see you Trillian,
Ford, Monkeyman
Hey, er, computer
Hi there, Mr Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to
Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast
Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go
Anywhere, doesn't matter, shouted Zaphod,  yes  it  does
he said again, we want to go to the nearest place to eat
Sure thing, said the computer happily and a  massive  explosion rocket the bridge
When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye,  he regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest
Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness
Consciousness had  died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the
pit of unbeing
The roar of silence echoed dismally  around  them and  they  sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red
that slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever
After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying on  a  cold  hard  shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of Life, the Universe, and Everything
Cold spasms shook them, lights danced  sickeningly  around  them
The  cold  hard  shore  tipped  and span and then stood still
It shone darkly - it was a very highly polished cold hard shore
A green blur watched them disapprovingly
It coughed
Good evening,  madam,  gentlemen,  it  said,  do  you  have  a reservation
Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back  like  elastic,  making his brain smart
He looked up woozily at the green blur
Reservation
he said weakly
Yes, sir, said the green blur
Do you need a reservation for the afterlife
In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did
Afterlife, sir
it said
Arthur Dent was grappling with  his  consciousness  the  way  one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath
Is this the afterlife
he stammered
Well I assume so, said Ford Prefect trying to  work  out  which way was up
He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite
direction from the cold hard shore on which  he  was  lying,  and staggered to what he hoped were his feet
I mean, he said, swaying gently, there's no way we could  have survived that blast is there
No, muttered Arthur
He had raised himself on to his elbows but it didn't seem to improve things
He slumped down again
No, said Trillian, standing up, no way at all
A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor
It  was  Zaphod Beeblebrox  attempting to speak
I certainly didn't survive, he
gurgled, I was a total goner
Wham bang and that was it
Yeah, thanks to you, said Ford, We didn't stand a  chance
We must have been blown to bits
Arms, legs everywhere
Yeah, said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet
If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks
said the green blur, hovering impatiently beside them
Kerpow, splat, continued Zaphod, instantaneously  zonked  into our  component molecules
Hey, Ford, he said, identifying one of
the slowly solidifying blurs around him, did you get that  thing of your whole life flashing before you
You got that too
said Ford, your whole life
Yeah, said Zaphod, at least I assume it was mine
I  spent  a lot of time out of my skulls you know
He looked at around him at the various shapes that were  at  last becoming  proper  shapes  instead of vague and wobbling shapeless shapes
So
he said
So what
said Ford
So here we are, said Zaphod hesitantly, lying dead
Standing, Trillian corrected him
Er, standing dead, continued Zaphod, in this desolate
Restaurant, said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and  could now, much to his surprise, see clearly
That is to say, the thing
that surprised him was not that he could see, but what  he  could see
Here we are, continued Zaphod doggedly, standing dead in  this desolate
Five star
said Trillian
Restaurant, concluded Zaphod
Odd isn't it
said Ford
Er, yeah
Nice chandeliers though, said Trillian
They looked about themselves in bemusement
It's not so much an afterlife, said Arthur,  more  a  sort  of apres vie
The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and  the low  vaulted  ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal Universe, have been painted in  that  particular  shade  of  deep turquoise,  and  even  if  it  had  been  it  wouldn't  have been highlighted by concealed moodlighting
This is not,  however,  an
ideal  Universe,  as  was  further  evidenced by the eye-crossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the  way  in  which  the fronting  for  the  eighty-yard  long  marble-topped bar had been made
The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had
been  made  by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that  the  twenty  thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in
A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar or  relaxing  in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were deployed here and there about  the  bar  area
A  young  Vl'Hurg
officer  and  his  green  steaming  young lady passed through the large smoked glass doors at the far  end  of  the  bar  into  the dazzling light of the main body of the Restaurant beyond
Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window
He  pulled  aside the  corner  of  the  curtain and looked out at a landscape which
under normal circumstances would have given Arthur  the  creeping horrors
These  were not, however, normal circumstances, for the
thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up  his back and off the top of his head was the sky
The sky was
An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place
All in good time, sir, he said
Zaphod's eyes flashed
Hey, hang about you dead guys, he said, I think we're  missing some ultra-important thing here you know
Something somebody said
and we missed it
Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he had just seen
He said, I said it was a sort of apres
Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't
said Zaphod, Ford
I said it was odd
Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was
Perhaps, interrupted the  green  blur  who  had  by  this  time resolved  into  the  shape  of  a small wizened dark-suited green waiter, perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks
Drinks
cried Zaphod, that was it
See what you  miss  if  you don't stay alert
Indeed sir,  said  the  waiter  patiently
If  the  lady  and gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner
Dinner
Zaphod exclaimed with passion,  Listen,  little  green person,  my  stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night
for the mere idea
and the Universe, concluded the waiter, determined  not  to be  deflected  on  his home stretch, will explode later for your
pleasure
Ford's head swivelled towards him
He spoke with feeling
Wow, he said, What sort of drinks do you serve in this place
The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh
Ah, he said, I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me
Oh, I hope not, breathed Ford
The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough
It is not unusual for our customers to be a  little  disoriented by the time journey, he said, so if I might suggest
Time journey
said Zaphod
Time journey
said Ford
Time journey
said Trillian
You mean this isn't the afterlife
said Arthur
The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile
He  had  almost exhausted  his  polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be
slipping into his role of a rather  tight  lipped  and  sarcastic little waiter
Afterlife sir
he said, No sir
And we're not dead
said Arthur
The waiter tightened his lips
Aha, ha, he said, Sir is most  evidently  alive,  otherwise  I would not attempt to serve sir
In an extraordinary gesture  which  is  pointless  attempting  to describe,  Zaphod  Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other
Hey guys, he said, This  is  crazy
We  finally  did  it
We finally got to where we were going
This is Milliways
Yes sir, said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel, this is Milliways - the Restaurant at the End of the Universe
End of what
said Arthur
The  Universe,  repeated   the   waiter,   very   clearly   and unnecessarily distinctly
When did that end
said Arthur
In just a few minutes, sir, said the waiter
He  took  a  deep breath
He  didn't  need  to do this since his body was supplied
with the peculiar assortment of gases it  required  for  survival from  a  small  intravenous device strapped to his leg
There are
times, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take  a deep breath
Now, if you would care to order drinks at  last,  he  said,  I will then show you to your table
Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over  to  the  bar  and bought most of it
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is  one  of  the  most extraordinary  ventures in the entire history of catering
It has
been built on the fragmented remains of
it will be  built  on the fragmented
that is to say it will have been built by this
time, and indeed has been - One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not  that of  accidentally  becoming your own father or mother
There is no
problem involved in becoming your own father  or  mother  that  a broadminded  and  well-adjusted  family can't cope with
There is
also no problem about changing the course of history - the course of  history  does  not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw
All the important changes have happened before the things
they  were  supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end
The major problem is quite simply one of grammar,  and  the  main work  to  consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations
It will  tell  you
for  instance  how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping  forward two  days  in  order  to  avoid  it
The event will be described
differently according to whether you are talking  about  it  from the  standpoint  of  your  own  natural  time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the  further  past  and  is  further complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time  to  another  with  the intention of becoming your own father or mother
Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and in fact in later editions of the book all  the  pages  beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs
The Hitch Hikers Guide to the  Galaxy  skips  lightly  over  this tangle  of  academic  abstraction,  pausing only to note that the term Future Perfect has been abandoned since it was  discovered not to be
To resume: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is  one  of  the  most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering
It is built on the fragmented remains  of  an  eventually  ruined planet  which  is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of the Universe
This is, many would say, impossible
In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat (willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen) the whole of creation explode around them
This is, many would say, equally impossible
You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any  sitting  you  like without  prior  (late fore-when) reservation because you can book retrospectively, as it were when you return  to  your  own  time
you  can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta retrohome

This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible
At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with  (mayan  meetan  con with  dinan  on  when)  a fascinating cross-section of the entire population of space and time
This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible
You can visit it as many times as you like  (mayan  on-visit  re- onvisiting
and so on - for further tense-corrections consult
Dr Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself, because of the embarrassment this usually causes
This, even if the rest were true, which  it  isn't,  is  patently impossible, say the doubters
All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings  account  in your  own  era,  and  when  you  arrive  at  the  End of Time the operation of compound interest means that the  fabulous  cost  of your meal has been paid for
This, many claim, is not merely impossible  but  clearly  insane, which  is  why  the  advertising executives of the star system of Bastablon  came  up  with  this  slogan:  If  you've  done   six impossible  things  this  morning,  why  not  round  it  off with breakfast  at  Milliways,  the  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the Universe
At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a  newt
His heads  knocked  together and his smiles were coming out of synch
He was miserably happy
Zaphod, said Ford, whilst  you're  still  capable  of  speech, would  you  care  to tell me what the photon happened
Where have
you been
Where have we been
Small  matter,  but  I'd  like  it cleared up
Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink  further into the obscurity of drink
Yeah, he said, I've been around
They want me to find the  man who  rules  the Universe, but I don't care to meet him
I believe
the man can't cook
His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded
True, it said, have another drink
Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has been  described  as  the  alcoholic  equivalent  of  a  mugging - expensive and bad for  the  head
Whatever  had  happened,  Ford
decided, he didn't really care too much
Listen Ford, said Zaphod, everything's cool and froody
You mean everything's under control
No, said Zaphod, I do not  mean  everything's  under  control
That  would  not  be  cool  and  froody
If you want to know what happened let's just say I had the whole situation in  my  pocket
OK
Ford shrugged
Zaphod giggled into his drink
It frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top
A wild-skinned sky-gypsy  approached  them  and  played  electric violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to go away again
The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another  part of the bar
I don't know what this place is, said Arthur, but I  think  it gives me the creeps
Have another drink, said Trillian, Enjoy yourself
Which
said Arthur, the two are mutually exclusive
Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you
You call this life
You're beginning to sound like Marvin
Marvin's the clearest thinker I know
How do you think  we  make this violinist go away
The waiter approached
Your table is ready, he said
Seen  from  the  outside,  which  it  never  is,  the  Restaurant resembles  a  giant  glittering  starfish  beached on a forgotten rock
Each of  its  arms  houses  the  bars,  the  kitchens,  the
forcefield  generators which protect the entire structure and the decayed planet on which it sits,  and  the  Time  Turbines  which slowly  rock  the  whole affair backwards and forwards across the crucial moment
In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome,  almost  a  complete globe,  and  it  was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and Trillian now passed
At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them, and  covered every available surface
The other surfaces were not
available  because  they  were  already  encrusted  with  jewels, precious  sea  shells  from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles, lizard skins and  a  million  unidentifiable  embellishments  and decorations
Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur
Dent goggled
Wowee, said Zaphod, Zappo
Incredible
breathed Arthur, the people

The  things
The things, said Ford Prefect quietly, are also people
The people
resumed Arthur, the
other people
The lights

said Trillian
The tables
said Arthur
The clothes

said Trillian
The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs
The End of the Universe is very popular, said Zaphod  threading his  way  unsteadily  through  the throng of tables, some made of marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of  platinum,  and at  each  a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves and studying menus
People like to dress up for it, continued Zaphod, Gives  it  a sense of occasion
The tables were fanned out in a large  circle  around  a  central stage  area where a small band were playing light music, at least a thousand tables was Arthur's guess,  and  interspersed  amongst them  were  swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary, in short all the paraphernalia common to  all  Restaurants  where little  expense  has  been  spared to give the impression that no expense has been spared
Arthur glanced around, half expecting to
see someone making an American Express commercial
Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod
Wowee, said Zaphod
Zappo, said Ford
My great granddaddy must have really screwed up  the  computer's works,  you  know,  said  Zaphod,  I  told it to take us to the nearest place to eat and it sends us to the End of the  Universe
Remind me to be nice to it one day
He paused
Hey, everybody's here you know
Everybody who was anybody
Was
said Arthur
At the End of the Universe you have to  use  the  past  tense  a lot,  said  Zaphod,  'cos  everything's been done you know
Hi,
guys, he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms, How did you do
Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox
asked one iguana of another iguana
I think so, replied the second iguana
Well doesn't that just take the biscuit, said the first iguana
Funny old thing, life, said the second iguana
It's what you make of it, said the first and they  lapsed  back into  silence
They  were  waiting  for the greatest show in the
Universe
Hey, Zaphod, said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of the  third  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster, missing
He pointed a
swaying finger
There's an old mate of mine, he said,  Hotblack  Desiato
See the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on
Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes  but  it  made him feel dizzy
Finally he saw
Oh yeah, he said, then recognition came a moment later
Hey, he said, did that guy ever make it megabig
Wow, bigger than the
biggest thing ever
Other than me
Who's he supposed to be
asked Trillian
Hotblack Desiato
said Zaphod in astonishment, you don't know
You never heard of Disaster Area
No, said Trillian, who hadn't
The biggest, said Ford, loudest
Richest
suggested Zaphod
rock band in the history of
he searched for the word
history itself, said Zaphod
No, said Trillian
Zowee, said Zaphod, here we are at the End of the Universe and you haven't even lived yet
Did you miss out
He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at the table
Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone
Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance
Hey, er, Hotblack, he called out, how you doing
Great to  see you  big boy, how's the noise
You're looking great, really very,
very fat and unwell
Amazing
He slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response
The Pan
Galactic Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him  told  him  to plunge on regardless
Remember the old days
he said, We used to  hang  out,  right
The   Bistro  Illegal,  remember
Slim's  Throat  Emporium
The Evildrome Boozarama, great days eh
Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great days or not
Ford was not perturbed
And when we were hungry we'd pose as public  health  inspectors, you  remember  that
And go around confiscating meals and drinks
right
Till we got food poisoning
Oh, and then  there  were  the long  nights  of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above
the Cafe Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always  in the  next  room  trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all hated them
And you said you didn't care,  and  we  said  we  did
because  we  hated  them  so much
Ford's eyes were beginning to mist over
And you said you didn't  want  to  be  a  star,  he  continued, wallowing  in  nostalgia,  because you despised the star system
And we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't  think  you had the option
And what do you do now
You buy star systems
He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables
Here, he said, is a man who buys star systems
Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or  deny  this fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly
I think someone's drunk, muttered a purple bush-like being into his wine glass
Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing Hotblack Desiato
What's that number you do
he  said,  unwisely  grabbing  at  a bottle  for  support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as
it happened
Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass
That really huge number, he continued, how does it go
Bwarm
Bwarm
Baderr
something, and in the stage act you do it ends up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and  you  actually
do it
Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat graphically
He knocked the bottle over again
Ship
Sun
Wham bang
he  cried
I  mean  forget  lasers  and stuff,  you  guys are into solar flares and real sunburn
Oh, and
terrible songs
His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on to the table
Something ought to be done about it, he thought
Hey, you want a drink
he said
It  began  to  sink  into  his squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and
that the missing something was in some  way  connected  with  the fact  that  the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said Hi, Ford or  Great  to see you after all this time, or in fact anything at all
More to
the point he had not yet even moved
Hotblack
said Ford
A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and  pushed him aside
He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to
see if he could spot the owner of  this  discourteous  hand
The owner  was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of
the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with  it
In fact  he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy
and with lots of solid stuffing
The suit into  which  the  man's body  had been stuffed looked as if it's only purpose in life was
to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into a  suit
The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of
an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended
Kid
said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth  as  if it had been having a really rough time down in his chest
Er, yeah
said Ford conversationally
He staggered back to  his feet  again  and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't
come further up the man's body
Beat it, said the man
Oh yeah
said Ford, wondering how wise he was being,  and  who are you
The man considered this for a moment
He  wasn't  used  to  being asked  this sort of question
Nevertheless, after a while he came
up with an answer
I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it, he said, before  you get it beaten for you
Now listen, said Ford nervously - he wished his head would stop spinning,  settle down and get to grips with the situation - Now listen, he continued, I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and
He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as an eyelash
and
said Ford again, wondering what  would  be  a  good word to say after and
The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after and
He said it
And I am Mr Desiato's bodyguard, it went, and I am responsible for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away before it gets damaged
Now wait a minute, said Ford
No minutes
boomed  the  bodyguard,  no  waiting
Mr  Desiato speaks to no one
Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about  the  matter himself, said Ford
He speaks to no one
bellowed the bodyguard
Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to  admit to  himself  that  the  bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side
There was still not the slightest  sign  of  movement,  let
alone keen interest in Ford's welfare
Why
said Ford, What's the matter with him
The bodyguard told him
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy,  but  in fact  the loudest noise of any kind at all
Regular concert goers
judge that the best sound balance is usually  to  be  heard  from within  large  concrete  bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments  by remote  control  from  within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet - or more  frequently  around  a completely different planet
Their songs are on the whole very simple and  mostly  follow  the familiar  theme  of  boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason
Many worlds have now banned their act altogether,  sometimes  for artistic  reasons,  but  most  commonly because the band's public address  system  contravenes  local  strategic  arms  limitations treaties
This has not, however, stopped their earnings from  pushing  back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research accountant   has   recently   been   appointed    Professor    of Neomathematics  at  the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns,  in  which he proves that the whole fabric of the space- time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent
Ford staggered  back  to  the  table  where  Zaphod,  Arthur  and Trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin
Gotta have some food, said Ford
Hi, Ford, said Zaphod, you speak to the big noise boy
Ford waggled his head noncommittally
Hotblack
I sort of spoke to him, yeah
What'd he say
Well, not a lot really
He's
er
Yeah
He's spending a year dead for  tax  reasons
I've  got  to  sit down
He sat down
The waiter approached
Would you like to see the menu
he said, or would you like  to meet the Dish of the Day
Huh
said Ford
Huh
said Arthur
Huh
said Trillian
That's cool, said Zaphod, we'll meet the meat
In a small room in one of the arms of the  Restaurant  complex  a tall,  thin,  gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in the face
It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him in  it  so  many times
It was too long for a start, the eyes too
sunken and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips  were  too thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently polished bay window
The  hands  that  held  the
curtain  were  long  and  thin too: they were also cold
They lay lightly along the folds of the curtain and  gave  the  impression
that if he didn't watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner
He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his  features went off to play somewhere more healthy
He prowled
around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's preying,  finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table, where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes
A bell rang
He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up
His  hands brushed  limply  over  some  of  the one million rainbow-coloured
sequins with which his jacket was  festooned,  and  he  was  gone through the door
In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace, a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that led up to the centre of the stage
Up the stairs bounded bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure
He  burst  on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone, removed it from its stand with one swoop of his  long  thin  hand and  stood  for  a  moment  bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging their applause  and  displaying  to  them  his  bay window
He  waved to his particular friends in the audience even
though there weren't any there, and waited for  the  applause  to die down
He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not  merely from  ear  to  ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere confines of his face
Thank you ladies and gentlemen
he cried, thank you very much
Thank you so much
He eyed them with a twinkling eye
Ladies and gentlemen, he said, The Universe as we know it  has now  been  in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour
So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End of the Universe
With a gesture he deftly conjured another  round  of  spontaneous applause
With another gesture he cut it
I  am  your  host  for  tonight,  he  said,  my  name  is  Max Quordlepleen
Everybody  knew  this,  his  act  was famous
throughout the known  Galaxy,  but  he  said  it  for  the  fresh applause  it  generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and wave

and I've just come straight from  the  very
very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar - where I can tell you we  had  a  very  exciting evening  ladies  and  gentlemen  -  and  I will be with you right through this historic occasion, the End of History itself
Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights  dimmed down   further
On   every  table  candles  ignited  themselves
spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all  the  diners  and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million intimate shadows
A tremor of  excitement  thrilled  through  the
darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade
Max's voice was hushed as he continued
So, ladies and gentlemen, he breathed, the  candles  are  lit, the  band  plays  softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us fades into transparency, revealing a dark  and  sullen  sky  hung heavy  with  the  ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse
Even the soft tootling of the band faded away  as  stunned  shock descended on all those who had not seen this sight before
A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them, - a hideous light, a boiling, pestilential light, a light that would have disfigured hell
The Universe was coming to an end
For a few  interminable  seconds  the  Restaurant  span  silently through the raging void
Then Max spoke again
For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the  end  of the tunnel, he said, this is it
The band struck up again
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, cried Max, I'll be back  with you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very capable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his  cataclysmic  Combo
Big
hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys
The baleful turmoil of the skies continued
Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a  moment  or  so normal  conversation  resumed
Max began his round of the tables,
swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living
A large dairy animal  approached  Zaphod  Beeblebrox's  table,  a large  fat  meaty  quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips
Good evening, it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, I am  the  main  Dish of the Day
May I interest you in parts of my
body
It  harrumphed  and  gurgled  a  bit,  wriggled  its  hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at
them
Its gaze was met by looks of startled  bewilderment  from  Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox
Something off  the  shoulder  perhaps
suggested  the  animal, Braised in a white wine sauce
Er, your shoulder
said Arthur in a horrified whisper
But naturally my shoulder, sir, mooed the  animal  contentedly, nobody else's is mine to offer
Zaphod leapt to his feet and started  prodding  and  feeling  the animal's shoulder appreciatively
Or the rump is very  good,  murmured  the  animal
I've  been exercising  it  and  eating  plenty of grain, so there's a lot of
good meat there
It gave  a  mellow  grunt,  gurgled  again  and started to chew the cud
It swallowed the cud again
Or a casserole of me perhaps
it added
You mean this animal actually wants us  to  eat  it
whispered Trillian to Ford
Me
said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes,  I  don't  mean anything
That's  absolutely  horrible,  exclaimed  Arthur,   the   most revolting thing I've ever heard
What's the problem Earthman
said Zaphod, now transferring  his attention to the animal's enormous rump
I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting me to, said Arthur, it's heartless
Better than eating an animal that doesn't  want  to  be  eaten, said Zaphod
That's not the point, Arthur protested
Then he  thought  about it  for  a  moment
Alright, he said, maybe it is the point
I
don't care, I'm not going to think about it now
I'll just
er
The Universe raged about him in its death throes
I think I'll just have a green salad, he muttered
May I urge you to consider my liver
asked the animal, it must be  very  rich  and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself
for months
A green salad, said Arthur emphatically
A green salad
said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur
Are you going to tell me, said Arthur, that I  shouldn't  have green salad
Well, said the animal, I know many vegetables  that  are  very clear  on  that  point
Which is why it was eventually decided to
cut through the whole tangled problem and breed  an  animal  that actually  wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly
And here I am
It managed a very slight bow
Glass of water please, said Arthur
Look, said Zaphod, we want to eat, we don't  want  to  make  a meal  of  the  issues
Four  rare  steaks  please, and hurry
We
haven't eaten in five hundred and  seventy-six  thousand  million years
The animal staggered to its feet
It gave a mellow gurgle
A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so
Very good,  it  said, I'll just nip off and shoot myself
He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur
Don't worry, sir, he said, I'll be very humane
It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen
A matter of minutes later  the  waiter  arrived  with  four  huge steaming  steaks
Zaphod  and  Ford  wolfed  straight  into them
without a second's hesitation
Trillian paused, then shrugged and started into hers
Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill
Hey, Earthman, said Zaphod with a malicious grin  on  the  face that wasn't stuffing itself, what's eating you
And the band played on
All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and  chatted
The  air  was  filled  with  talk  of this and that, and with the mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and  insidious wines
For  an  infinite  number of miles in every direction the
universal  cataclysm  was  gathering  to  a  stupefying   climax
Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish
And now, ladies and gentlemen, he beamed, is  everyone  having one last wonderful time
Yes, called out the sort of people  who  call  out  yes  when comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time
That's wonderful, enthused Max, absolutely wonderful
And  as the  photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing
to tear apart the last of the red hot suns,  I  know  you're  all going  to  settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find all an immensely exciting and terminal experience
He paused
He caught the audience with a glittering eye
Believe me, ladies and gentlemen,  he  said,  there's  nothing penultimate about this one
He paused again
Tonight his timing was  immaculate
Time  after time  he had done this show, night after night
Not that the word
night had any meaning here at the extremity of  time
All  there was  was  the  endless  repetition  of  the  final moment, as the
Restaurant  rocked  slowly  forward  over  the  brink  of  time's furthest edge - and back again
This night was good though, the
audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand
His  voice dropped
They had to strain to hear him
This, he said, really is the absolute end, the final  chilling desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes extinct
This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial `it'
He dropped his voice still lower
In the stillness, a  fly  would not have dared cleat its throat
After this,  he  said,  there  is  nothing
Void
Emptiness
Oblivion
Absolute nothing
His eyes glittered again - or did they twinkle
Nothing
except of course for the sweet trolley, and  a  fine selection of Aldebaran liqueurs
The band gave him a musical sting
He wished  they  wouldn't,  he didn't  need  it, not an artist of his calibre
He could play the
audience like his own musical instrument
They were laughing with relief
He followed on
And for once, he cried cheerily, you don't need to worry about having  a  hangover  in  the morning - because there won't be any more mornings
He beamed at his happy, laughing audience
He glanced up  at  the sky,  going  through  the  same dead routine every night, but his
glance was only for a fraction of a second
He trusted it  to  do its job, as one professional trusts another
And now, he said, strutting about the stage, at  the  risk  of putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties
He pulled a card from his pocket
Do we have
he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, Do we have  a  party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club
from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne
Are they here
A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear
He peered around trying to find them
Are they here
he asked again, to elict a louder cheer
He got it, as he always did
Ah, there they are
Well, last bids  lads  -  and  no  cheating, remember this is a very solemn moment
He lapped up the laughter
And do we also have, do we have
a  party  of  minor  deities from the Halls of Asgard
Away to his right came  a  rumble  of  thunder
Lightning  arced across  the  stage
A  small group of hairy men with helmets sat
looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to him
Hasbeens, he thought to himself
Careful with that hammer, sir, he said
They did their trick with the lightning again
Max  gave  them  a very thin lipped smile
And thirdly, he said, thirdly a party of  Young  Conservatives from Sirius B, are they here
A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing  rolls  at each  other  and started throwing rolls at the stage
They yapped
and barked unintelligibly
Yes, said Max, well this is all your fault, you realize that
And finally, said Max, quieting the audience down  and  putting on  his  solemn  face,  finally  I  believe we have with us here tonight, a party of believers, very devout  believers,  from  the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon
There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of the  floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously, and staying apart from the festivities
They blinked  resentfully
as the spotlight was turned on them
There they are, said Max, sitting there,  patiently
He  said he'd  come again, and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's
hope he's hurrying fellas, because he's only  got  eight  minutes left
The party of  Zarquon's  followers  sat  rigid,  refusing  to  be buffeted  by  the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them
Max restrained his audience
No, but seriously though folks,  seriously  though,  no  offence meant
No,  I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs,
so I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon
The audience clapped respectfully
wherever he's got to
He blew a kiss to the  stony-faced  party  and  returned  to  the centre of the stage
He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it
It's marvellous though, he rattled on, to see so many  of  you here  tonight  -  no isn't it though
Yes, absolutely marvellous
Because I know that so many of you come here time and time again, which  I  think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final end of everything, and then return home to your own eras
and
raise  families,  strive  for  new  and  better  societies, fight terrible wars for what you know to be right
it  really  gives
one  hope  for  the future of all lifekind
Except of course, he waved at the blitzing turmoil above and  around  them,  that  we
know it hasn't got one
Arthur turned to Ford - he hadn't quite got this place worked out in his mind
Look, surely, he said, if the Universe is  about  to  end
don't we go with it
Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in  other words a rather unsteady one
No, he said, look, he said, as soon as you  come  into  this dive you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal warp thing
I think
Oh, said Arthur
He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak
Look, said Ford, I'll show you
He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly  with it
Look, he said  again,  imagine  this  napkin,  right,  as  the temporal Universe, right
And this spoon as a transductional mode
in the matter curve
It took him a while to say this last part, and  Arthur  hated  to interrupt him
That's the spoon I was eating with, he said
Alright, said Ford, imagine this spoon
he found  a  small wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, this spoon
but found it
rather tricky to pick up, no, better still this fork
Hey would you let go of my fork
snapped Zaphod
Alright, said Ford, alright, alright
Why don't we say
why don't we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe
What, the one you've just knocked on the floor
Did I do that
Yes
Alright, said Ford, forget that
I mean
I mean,  look,  do you know - do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick
off
Probably not, said Arthur, who wished he'd  never  embarked  on any of this
Alright, said Ford, imagine this
Right
You  get  this  bath
Right
A large round bath
And it's made of ebony
Where from
said Arthur, Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons
Doesn't matter
So you keep saying
Listen
Alright
You get this bath, see
Imagine you've got this bath
And  it's ebony
And it's conical
Conical
said Arthur, What sort of
Shhh
said Ford
It's conical
So what you do is, you see, you fill it with fine white sand, alright
Or sugar
Fine white sand,
and/or sugar
Anything
Doesn't matter
Sugar's  fine
And  when it's full, you pull the plug out
are you listening
I'm listening
You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls  away you see, out of the plughole
I see
You don't see
You don't see at all
I haven't got to the clever bit yet
You want to hear the clever bit
Tell me the clever bit
I'll tell you the clever bit
Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit was
The clever bit, he said, is this
You film it happening
Clever
That's not the clever bit
This is the clever  bit,  I  remember now  that this is the clever bit
The clever bit is that you then
thread the film in the projector
backwards
Backwards
Yes
Threading it backwards is definitely  the  clever  bit
So then,  you  just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to
spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath
See
And that's how the Universe began is it
said Arthur
No, said Ford, but it's a marvellous way to relax
He reached for his wine glass
Where's my wine glass
he said
It's on the floor
Ah
Tipping back his chair to look for it,  Ford  collided  with  the small  green  waiter  who  was  approaching  the table carrying a portable telephone
Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because he was extremely drunk
The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly understood
Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table
Mr Zaphod Beeblebrox
inquired the waiter
Er, yeah
said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak
There is a phone call for you
Hey, what
A phone call, sir
For me
Here
Hey, but who knows where I am
One of his minds raced
The other dawdled lovingly over the  food it was still shovelling in
Excuse me if I carry on, won't you
said his  eating  head  and carried on
There were now so many people  after  him  he'd  lost  count
He shouldn't  have  made  such a conspicuous entrance
Hell, why not
though, he thought
How do you know you're having fun if  there's no one watching you have it
Maybe  someone  here  tipped  off  the  Galactic  Police,  said Trillian
Everyone saw you come in
You mean they want to arrest me over the  phone
said  Zaphod, Could be
I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm concerned
Yeah, said a voice from under the table, you go to  pieces  so fast people get hit by the shrapnel
Hey, what is this, Judgment Day
snapped Zaphod
Do we get to see that as well
asked Arthur nervously
I'm in no hurry, muttered Zaphod, OK, so who's the cat on  the phone
He kicked Ford
Hey get up there, kid, he said to him,
I may need you
I am not, said the  waiter,  personally  acquainted  with  the metal gentlemen in question, sir
Metal
Yes, sir
Did you say metal
Yes, sir
I said that I am not personally  acquainted  with  the metal gentleman in question
OK, carry on
But I am informed that he has been awaiting your  return  for  a considerable number of millennia
It seems you left here somewhat
precipitately
Left here
said Zaphod, are you being strange
We  only  just arrived here
Indeed, sir, persisted the waiter  doggedly,  but  before  you arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here
Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other
You're saying, he said, that before we arrived here,  we  left here
This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter
Precisely, sir, he said
Put your analyst on danger money, baby, advised Zaphod
No, wait a minute, said Ford, emerging above table level again, where exactly is here
To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B
But we just left there, protested Zaphod, we  left  there  and came to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe
Yes, sir, said the waiter, feeling that he  was  now  into  the home  stretch  and  running well, the one was constructed on the ruins of the other
Oh, said Arthur brightly, you mean we've travelled in time but not in space
Listen you semi-evolved simian, cut in Zaphod, go climb a tree will you
Arthur bristled
Go bang your heads together four-eyes, he advised Zaphod
No, no, the waiter said to Zaphod,  your  monkey  has  got  it right, sir
Arthur stuttered in fury and said  nothing  apposite,  or  indeed coherent
You jumped forward
I believe five  hundred  and  seventy-six thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place,
explained the waiter
He smiled
He had a wonderful feeling  that he  had  finally  won  through  against  what  had  seemed  to be
insuperable odds
That's it
said Zaphod, I got it
I told the computer to  send us  to the nearest place to eat, that's exactly what it did
Give
or take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million  years,  we never moved
Neat
They all agreed this was very neat
But who, said Zaphod, is the cat on the phone
Whatever happened to Marvin
said Trillian
Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads
The Paranoid Android
I left him moping about on Frogstar B
When was this
Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six  thousand  million  years ago I suppose, said Zaphod, Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate Captain
The little waiter's  eyebrows  wandered  about  his  forehead  in confusion
I beg your pardon, sir
he said
The phone, waiter, said Zaphod, grabbing it off him
Shee, you guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off
Indeed, sir
Hey, Marvin, is that you
said Zaphod into the phone, How  you doing, kid
There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line
I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed, it said
Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone
It's Marvin, he said
Hey, Marvin, he said into the  phone  again,  we're  having  a great  time
Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe
going foom
Where can we find you
Again the pause
You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know, said Marvin at last, I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot
OK, OK, said Zaphod, but where are you
Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they  say  to  me, `open  airlock number three, Marvin
Marvin, can you pick up that
piece of paper
Can I pick up that piece of paper
Here  I  am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to
Yeah, yeah, sympathized Zaphod hardly at all
But I'm quite used to being humiliated, droned Marvin,  I  can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like
Would
you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket  of  water
I've got one ready
Wait a minute
Er, hey, Marvin
interrupted Zaphod, but it  was  too  late
Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line
What's he saying
asked Trillian
Nothing, said Zaphod, he just phoned up to wash  his  head  at us
There, said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit, I hope that gave satisfaction
Yeah, yeah, said Zaphod, now will you please tell us where you are
I'm in the car park, said Marvin
The car park
said Zaphod, what are you doing there
Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park
OK, hang in there, we'll be right down
In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw  down  the  phone and wrote Hotblack Desiato on the bill
Come on guys, he said, Marvin's in the car park
Let's get  on down
What's he doing in the car park
asked Arthur
Parking cars, what else
Dum dum
But what about the End of  the  Universe
We'll  miss  the  big moment
I've seen it
It's rubbish, said Zaphod, nothing  but  a  gnab gib
A what
Opposite of a big bang
Come on, let's get zappy
Few of the other diners paid them any attention  as  they  weaved their  way  through  the  Restaurant to the exit
Their eyes were
riveted on the horror of the skies
An interesting effect to watch for, Max was telling  them,  is in  the  upper  left-hand  quadrant of the sky, where if you look very carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away into the ultra-violet
Anyone here from Hastromil
There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere  at the back
Well, said Max beaming cheerfully at them, it's  too  late  to worry about whether you left the gas on now
The main reception foyer was almost empty but  Ford  nevertheless weaved his way through it
Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred  him  into  a cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall
What are you doing to him
asked Arthur
Sobering him up, said Zaphod and pushed a  coin  into  a  slot
Lights flashed, gases swirled
Hi, said Ford stepping  out  a  moment  later,  where  are  we going
Down to the car park, come on
What about the personnel Time Teleports
said  Ford,  Get  us straight back to the Heart of Gold
Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship
Zarniwoop  can  have  it
I don't want to play his games
Let's see what we can find
A  Sirius   Cybernetics   Corporation   Happy   Vertical   People Transporter  took  them  down deep into the substrata beneath the Restaurant
They were glad to see  it  had  been  vandalized  and
didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down
At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a  blast  of cold stale air hit them
The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long  concrete wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty major lifeforms
Nevertheless, like every  car  park
in  the  Galaxy  throughout the entire history of car parks, this car park smelt predominantly of impatience
They turned a corner and found themselves  on  a  moving  catwalk that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim distance
It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship belonging  to  one  of  the  diners  upstairs,  some smallish and utilitarian  mass  production   models,   others   vast   shining limoships, the playthings of the very rich
Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or  may  not  have been  avarice  as  he  passed  over them
In fact it's best to be
clear on this point - avarice is definitely what it was
There he is, said Trillian, Marvin, down there
They looked where she was pointing
Dimly they could see a  small metal  figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner
of a giant silver suncruiser
At short intervals along the  moving  catwalk,  wide  transparent tubes  led  down  to  floor level
Zaphod stepped off the catwalk
into one and  floated  gently  downwards
The  others  followed
Thinking  back  to  this  later,  Arthur  Dent thought it was the single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy
Hey, Marvin, said Zaphod striding over towards  to  him,  Hey, kid, are we pleased to see you
Marvin turned, and in so far as it  is  possible  for  a  totally inert metal face to look reproachfully, this is what it did
No you're not, he said, no one ever is
Suit yourself, said Zaphod and turned away to ogle  the  ships
Ford went with him
Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin
No, really we are, said Trillian and patted him in a  way  that he  disliked  intensely,  hanging around waiting for us all this time
Five hundred and seventy-six thousand  million,  three  thousand five  hundred  and  seventy-nine  years, said Marvin, I counted them
Well, here we are now, said Trillian, felling - quite correctly in Marvin's view - that it was a slightly foolish thing to say
The first ten million years were the worst, said  Marvin,  and the  second ten million years, they were the worst too
The third
million years I didn't enjoy at all
After that I went into a bit of decline
He paused just long enough to make them feel they  ought  to  say something, and then interrupted
It's the people you meet in this job that really get you  down, he said and paused again
Trillian cleared her throat
Is that
The best conversation I had was over forty million  years  ago, continued Marvin
Again the pause
Oh d
And that was with a coffee machine
He waited
That's a
You don't like talking to me do  you
said  Marvin  in  a  low desolate tone
Trillian talked to Arthur instead
Further down the chamber Ford  Prefect  had  found  something  of which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact
Zaphod, he said in a quiet voice, just look at some  of  these little star trolleys
Zaphod looked and liked
The craft they were looking at  was  in  fact  pretty  small  but extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy
It was not much to
look at
It resembled nothing so  much  as  a  paper  dart  about twenty  feet  long made of thin but tough metal foil
At the rear
end was a small horizontal two-man cockpit
It had a tiny  charm- drive  engine,  which  was  not capable of moving it at any great
speed
The thing it did have, however, was a heat-sink
The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand  billion  tons  and was  contained  within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic field situated half-way along the length of the  ship,  and  this heat-sink  enabled  the  craft  to  be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the  solar  flares that burst out from its surface
Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence,  and  those who can dare and afford it are amongst the most  lionized  men  in  the  Galaxy
It  is  also   of   course
stupefyingly  dangerous  -  those who don't die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of  the  Daedalus  Club's  Apres- Flare parties
Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on
And this baby, said Ford, the tangerine star  buggy  with  the black sunbusters
Again, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally  misnamed  one in   fact,   because   the  one  thing  it  couldn't  manage  was interstellar distances
Basically it was a sporty  planet  hopper
dolled  up to something it wasn't
Nice lines though
They passed on
The next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach  built limoship  and  obviously  designed  with one aim in mind, that of making the beholder sick with envy
The paintwork  and  accessory
detail  clearly  said  Not  only am I rich enough to afford this ship, I am also rich enough not to take  it  seriously
It  was
wonderfully hideous
Just look at  it,  said  Zaphod,  multi-cluster  quark  drive, perspulex running boards
Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job
He examined every inch
Yes, he said,  look,  the  infra-pink  lizard  emblem  on  the neutrino cowling
Lazlar's trade mark
The man has no shame
I was passed by one of these  mothers  once,  out  by  the  Axel Nebula,  said  Ford,  I  was going flat out and this thing just strolled  past  me,  star  drive  hardly   ticking   over
Just
incredible
Zaphod whistled appreciatively
Ten seconds later, said Ford, it  smashed  straight  into  the third moon of Jaglan Beta
Yeah, right
Amazing looking ship though
Looks like a  fish,  moves  like  a fish, steers like a cow
Ford looked round the other side
Hey, come and see, he called out, there's a big mural  painted on  this  side
A bursting sun - Disaster Area's trade mark
This
must be Hotblack's ship
Lucky old bugger
They do this  terrible song  you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun
Meant to be  an  amazing  spectacle
Expensive  in  stunt  ships though
Zaphod's attention  however  was  elsewhere
His  attention  was riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato's limo
His
mouths hung open
That, he said, that
is really bad for the eyes
Ford looked
He too stood astonished
It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon, twenty  yards  long,  very  clean, very sleek
There was just one
remarkable thing about it
It's so
black
said Ford Prefect, you can hardly make  out its shape
light just seems to fall into it
Zaphod said nothing
He had simply fallen in love
The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost  impossible to tell how close you were standing to it
Your eyes just slide off it
said Ford in wonder
It was  an emotional moment
He bit his lip
Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a  man  possessed  -  or more  accurately  like  a  man  who  wanted  to possess
His hand
reached out to stroke it
His hand stopped
His hand reached  out to stroke it again
His hand stopped again
Come and feel the surface, he said in a hushed voice
Ford put his hand out to feel it
His hand stopped
You
you can't
he said
See
said Zaphod, it's just totally frictionless
This must be one mother of a mover
He turned to look at Ford seriously
At least, one of  his  heads did - the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship
What do you reckon, Ford
he said
You mean
er
Ford looked over his  shoulder
You  mean stroll off with it
You think we should
No
Nor do I
But we're going to, aren't we
How can we not
They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly  pulled  himself together
We better shift soon, he said
In a moment or so the  Universe will  have  ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down
here to find their bourge-mobiles
Zaphod, said Ford
Yeah
How do we do it
Simple, said Zaphod
He turned
Marvin
he called
Slowly, laboriously, and  with  a  million  little  clanking  and creaking  noises  that  he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned round to answer the summons
Come on over here, said Zaphod, We've got a job for you
Marvin trudged towards them
I won't enjoy it, he said
Yes you will,  enthused  Zaphod,  there's  a  whole  new  life stretching out ahead of you
Oh, not another one, groaned Marvin
Will you shut up and listen
hissed Zaphod, this time  there's going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things
Sounds awful, Marvin said
Marvin
All I'm trying to ask you
I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you
What
Er
yes
Yeah, that's right, said Zaphod  jumpily
He was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance
Time was short
Well I wish you'd just tell me rather  than  try  to  engage  my enthusiasm, said Marvin, because I haven't got one
He walked on up to the ship, touched it,  and  a  hatchway  swung open
Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening
Don't mention it, said Marvin, Oh,  you  didn't
He  trudged away again
Arthur and Trillian clustered round
What's happening
asked Arthur
Look at this, said Ford, look at the interior of this ship
Weirder and weirder, breathed Zaphod
It's black, said Ford, Everything in it is just totally  black
In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment  after which there wouldn't be any more moments
All eyes were fixed on the dome, other  than  those  of  Hotblack Desiato's  bodyguard,  which  were  looking  intently at Hotblack Desiato,  and  those  of  Hotblack  Desiato  himself  which   the bodyguard had closed out of respect
The bodyguard leaned forward over the table
Had Hotblack Desiato been  alive,  he probably would have deemed this a good moment to
lean back, or even go for a short walk
His bodyguard was  not  a man  which improved with proximity
On account of his unfortunate
condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert
Mr Desiato, sir
whispered the bodyguard
Whenever he spoke, it looked  as  if  the  muscles  on  either  side  of his mouth were
clambering over each other to get out of the way
Mr Desiato
Can you hear me
Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing
Hotblack
hissed the bodyguard
Again,  quite  naturally,  Hotblack  Desiato   did   not   reply
Supernaturally, however, he did
On the table in front of him a wine glass  rattled,  and  a  fork rose  an  inch  or so and tapped against the glass
It settled on
the table again
The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt
It's time we get going, Mr  Desiato,  muttered  the  bodyguard, don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition
You
want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed
There was a  really big  audience  for  it
One of the best
Kakrafoon
Five-hundred
seventy-six thousand and two million years ago
Had you will have been looking forward to it
The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of  way  and dropped again
Ah, come on, said the  bodyguard,  it's  going  to  have  been great
You  knocked 'em cold
The bodyguard would have given Dr
Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack
The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and  the  new one's  a  beauty
Be  real sorry to see it go
If we get on down
there, I'll set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off  in the limo
OK
The fork  tapped  once  in  agreement,  and  the  glass  of  wine mysteriously emptied itself
The  bodyguard  wheeled  Hotblack  Desiato's  chair  out  of  the Restaurant
And now, cried Max from the centre of the  stage,  the  moment you've  all  been  waiting  for
He flung his arms into the air
Behind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords
Max  had  argued with them about this but they had
claimed it was in their contract that that's what they would  do
His agent would have to sort it out
The skies begin to boil
he cried
Nature collapses  into  the screaming void
In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will
be at an end
See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us
The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them - and  at  that moment  a  still  small  trumpet  sounded  as  from  an  infinite distance
Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the  band
None
of  them seemed to be playing a trumpet
Suddenly a wisp of smoke was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him
The trumpet
was joined by more trumpets
Over five hundred times Max had done this show, and nothing like this had  ever  happened  before
He
drew  back  in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient  man, bearded,  robed and wreathed in light
In his eyes were stars and
on his brow a golden crown
What's this
whispered Max, wild-eyed, what's happening
At the back of the Restaurant  the  stony-faced  party  from  the Church  of  the  Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying
Max blinked in amazement
He threw up his arms to the audience
A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen, he hollered, for  the Great Prophet Zarquon
He has come
Zarquon has come again
Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage  and handed his microphone to the Prophet
Zarquon coughed
He peered round at the assembled gathering
The stars  in  his  eyes  blinked uneasily
He handled the microphone
with confusion
Er
he said, hello
Er, look, I'm sorry  I'm  a  bit  late
I've  had  the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment
He seemed nervous of the expectant  awed  hush
He  cleared  his throat
Er, how are we for time
he said, have I just got a min- And so the Universe ended
One of the major selling point of that wholly  remarkable  travel book,  the  Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  to  the Galaxy, apart from its relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words Don't Panic written   in   large  friendly  letters  on  its  cover,  is  its compendious and occasionally accurate  glossary
The  statistics
relating  to the geo-social nature of the Universe, for instance, are deftly set out between pages nine  hundred  and  thirty-eight thousand  and  twenty-four  and  nine  hundred  and  thirty-eight thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in  which  they are  written  is  partly  explained by the fact that the editors, having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information  off the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it with a few footnoted in order  to  avoid  prosecution  under  the incomprehensibly tortuous Galactic Copyright laws
It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book  backwards  in  time  through  a  temporal  warp,  and  then successfully sued the breakfast cereal company  for  infringement of the same laws
Here is a sample: The Universe - some information to help you live in it
1~Area: Infinite
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this  definition  of the word Infinite
Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some
Much bigger  than  that  in  fact, really amazingly immense, a totally
stunning size, wow, that's big, time
Infinity is just  so  big that  by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy
Gigantic
multiplied by colossal multiplied by  staggeringly  huge  is  the sort of concept we're trying to get across here
2~Imports: None
It is impossible to import things into an  infinite  area,  there being no outside to import things in from
3~Exports: None
See imports
4~Population: None
It is known that there are an infinite number of  worlds,  simply because  there  is an infinite amount of space for them to be in
However, not every one of them  is  inhabited
Therefore,  there must  be  a  finite number of inhabited worlds
Any finite number
divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes  no  odds,  so the  average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero
From this it follows that the population of  the
whole  Universe  is  also  zero, and that any people you may meet from  time  to  time  are  merely  the  products  of  a  deranged imagination
5~Monetary Units: None
In fact there are three  freely  convertible  currencies  in  the Galaxy,  but none of them count
The Altairan Dollar has recently
collapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead  is  only  exchangeable  for other  Flaninian  Pobble  Beads,  and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems
Its exchange rate of eight Ningis  to  one
Pu  is  simple  enough,  but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each  side,  no  one has  ever  collected  enough  to  own  one  Pu
Ningis  are  not
negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse  to  deal  in fiddling  small change
From this basic premise it is very simple
to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination
6~Art: None
The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there simply isn't a mirror big enough - see point one
7~Sex: None
Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely  because  of the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that might keep all the non-existent people of the Universe occupied
However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now because   it   really   is   terribly  complicated
For  further
information  see  Guide  Chapters  seven,  nine,   ten,   eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide
The  Restaurant  continued  existing,  but  everything  else  had stopped
Temporal  relastatics  held  it  and  protected it in a
nothingness that wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing  - there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist
The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque,  the party  was  over,  the  diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished along with the rest of  the  Universe,  the  Time  Turbines  were preparing to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in his  small  curtained  dressing room trying to raise his agent on the tempophone
In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent
In to the car park came the late Mr Hotblack  Desiato,  propelled along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard
They descended one of the tubes
As they approached the  limoship a  hatchway  swung  down from its side, engaged the wheels of the
wheelchair and drew it inside
The bodyguard followed, and having seen  his  boss  safely connected up to his death-support system,
moved up to the  small  cockpit
Here  he  operated  the  remote control  system  which  activated the autopilot in the black ship
lying next to the limo,  thus  causing  great  relief  to  Zaphod Beeblebrox  who  had  been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes
The black ship glided smoothly forward out of  its  bay,  turned, and  moved  down the central causeway swiftly and quietly
At the
end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past
The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission,  a  passage  from the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
The passage is this:
The History of every major Galactic Civilization  tends  to  pass through   three   distinct  and  recognizable  phases,  those  of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases
For instance, the first phase is characterized  by  the  question How  can  we  eat
the second by the question Why do we eat
and the third by the question, Where shall we have lunch
The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the End  of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third question
What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually  take a  large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the How, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity
How are we doing
said Arthur Dent
Badly, said Ford Prefect
Where are we going
said Trillian
I don't know, said Zaphod Beeblebrox
Why not
demanded Arthur Dent
Shut up, suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect
Basically,  what  you're  trying  to  say,  said  Arthur  Dent, ignoring this suggestion, is that we're out of control
The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford  and  Zaphod tried to wrest control from the autopilot
The engined howled and
whined like tired children in a supermarket
It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me, said  Zaphod  whose love  affair  with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into the flight, Every time you try to  operate  on  of  these  weird black  controls that are labelled in black on a black background, a little black light lights up black to let you know you've  done it
What is this
Some kind of galactic hyperhearse
The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the  ceiling  was black,  the  seats  -  which  were  rudimentary  since  the  only important trip this ship was designed  for  was  supposed  to  be unmanned   -  were  black,  the  control  panel  was  black,  the instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place were  black,  the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and when they had lifted up a corner of it they had  discovered  that the foam underlay also was black
Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wavelengths, offered Trillian
Or didn't have much imagination, muttered Arthur
Perhaps, said Marvin, he was feeling very depressed
In fact, though they weren't to  know  it,  the  decor  had  been chosen in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, and tax-deductible condition
The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch
Take it easy, pleaded Arthur, you're making me space sick
Time sick,  said  Ford,  we're  plummeting  backwards  through time
Thank you, said Arthur, now I think I really am  going  to  be ill
Go ahead, said Zaphod, we could do with a little colour  about this place
This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation  is  it
snapped Arthur
Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over to Arthur
Look, Earthman, he said angrily,  you've  got  a  job  to  do, right
The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right
What, that thing
said Arthur, I thought we'd forgotten  about that
Not me, baby
Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of  money  in the  right quarters
And it's all locked up in that head thing of
yours
Yes but
But nothing
Think about it
The Meaning of  Life
We  get  our fingers  on  that  we  can  hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to
ransom, and that's worth a bundle
I owe mine a mint
Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm
Alright, he said, but where do we start
How  should  I  know
They  say  the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I supposed to know what the question is
It could  be  anything
I
mean, what's six times seven
Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment
Then his eyes blazed with excitement
Forty-two
he cried
Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead
Yes, he said patiently, I know that
Zaphod's faces fell
I'm just saying that the question could  be  anything  at  all, said Arthur, and I don't see how I am meant to know
Because, hissed Zaphod, you were there when  your  planet  did the big firework
We have a thing on Earth
began Arthur
Had, corrected Zaphod
called tact
Oh never mind
Look, I just don't know
A low voice echoed dully round the cabin
I know, said Marvin
Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a  losing battle with
Stay out of this Marvin, he said, this is organism talk
It's printed in the Earthman's  brainwave  patterns,  continued Marvin, but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing that
You mean, said Arthur, you mean you can see into my mind
Yes, said Marvin
Arthur stared in astonishment
And
he said
It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small
Ah, said Arthur, abuse
Yes, confirmed Marvin
Ah, ignore him, said Zaphod, he's only making it up
Making it up
said Marvin, swivelling his head in a  parody  of astonishment,  Why should I want to make anything up
Life's bad
enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it
Marvin, said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was  still  capable  of  assuming  in talking to this misbegotten creature, if you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us
Marvin's head swivelled back to her
You didn't ask, he said simply
Well, we're asking you now, metal man, said Ford, turning round to look at him
At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum
Hey, Ford, said Zaphod, that sounds good
Have you worked  out the controls of this boat
No, said Ford, I just stopped fiddling with them
I reckon  we just go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast
Yeah, right, said Zaphod
I could tell you weren't really interested, murmured Marvin  to himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off
Trouble is, said Ford, that the one instrument in  this  while ship  that  is giving any reading is worrying me
If it is what I
think it is, and if it's saying what I think  it's  saying,  then we've  already  gone too far back into the past
Maybe as much as
two million years before our own time
Zaphod shrugged
Time is bunk, he said
I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway, said Arthur
Me, said Zaphod
No
Who it really belongs to
Really me, insisted Zaphod, look, property  is  theft,  right
Therefore theft is property
Therefore this ship is mine, OK
Tell the ship that, said Arthur
Zaphod strode over to the console
Ship, he said, banging on the panels, this is your  new  owner speaking to
He got no further
Several things happened at once
The ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real space
All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the time trip now lit up
A  large  vision  screen  above  the  console  winked  into  life revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them
None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin, as were all the others
They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of  noise  that thuddered  out  of  the  monitor  speakers surrounding the vision screen
Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in  the  middle  of  the vast  Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system
That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage technicians
They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's
giant control ship which hung in orbit some  four  hundred  miles above  the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound system from there
Anyone within five miles of the speaker  silos
wouldn't have survived the tuning up
If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of  the  speaker  silos then  his  expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan
Risen out of the
silos,  the  neutron  phase  speaker  stacks  towered monstrously against the sky, obscuring the banks of  plutonium  reactors  and seismic amps behind them
Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers  lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and  the  Megabang drum complex
It was going to be a noisy show
Aboard the giant control  ship,  all  was  activity  and  bustle
Hotblack  Desiato's  limoship,  a  mere  tadpole  beside  it, had arrived  and  docked,  and  the  lamented  gentleman  was   being transported  down  the  high vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard
A doctor, a  logician  and  a  marine  biologist  had  also  just arrived,  flown  in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try to reason with the lead singer who  had  locked  himself  in  the bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish
The
bass  player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on board
Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on  a beach  on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found  a small stone that would be his friend
The band's manager was profoundly relieved
It meant that for the seventeenth  time  on  this  tour  the drums would be played by a
robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would  be right
The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications  of  the  stage technicians  testing  the  speaker channels, and this it was that was being relayed to the interior of the black ship
Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the  cabin,  and listened to the voices on the monitor speakers
OK, channel nine on  power,  said  a  voice,  testing  channel fifteen
Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship
Channel fifteen AOK, said another voice
A third voice cut in
The black stunt ship is now in position, it said, it's looking good
Gonna be a great sundive
Stage computer on line
A computer voice answered
On line, it said
Take control of the black ship
Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby
Testing channel twenty
Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched  frequencies  on  the sub-ether  receiver  before  the  next mind-pulverizing noise hit them
He stood there quivering
What, said Trillian in  a  small  quiet  voice,  does  sundive mean
It means, said Marvin, that the ship os going to dive into the sun
Sun
Dive
It's very simple to understand
What do you
expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship
How do you know
said Zaphod in a voice that  would  make  a Vegan  snow  lizard feel chilly, that this is Hotblack Desiato's
stuntship
Simple, said Marvin, I parked it for him
The why
didn't
you
tell us
You said you wanted excitement and  adventure  and  really  wild things
This is awful, said Arthur unnecessarily  in  the  pause  which followed
That's what I said, confirmed Marvin
On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up  a public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin
fine weather  for  the  concert  here  this  afternoon
I'm standing  here in front of the stage, the reporter lied, in the
middle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the  aid  of  hyperbinoptic glasses  I  can  just  about  make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all around me
Behind me the speaker  stacks
rise  like  a  sheer  cliff  face,  and  high above me the sun is shining away and  doesn't  know  what's  going  to  hit  it
The
environmentalist  lobby  do know what's going to hit it, and they claim that the  concert  will  cause  earthquakes,  tidal  waves, hurricanes,  irreparable  damage  to  the atmosphere, and all the usual things that environmentalists usually go on about
But I've just had a report that  a  representative  of  Disaster Area  met  with  the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of
Zaphod switched it off
He turned to Ford
You know what I'm thinking
he said
I think so, said Ford
Tell me what you think I'm thinking
I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship
I think you're right, said Zaphod
I think you're right, said Ford
How
said Arthur
Quiet, said Ford and Zaphod, we're thinking
So this is it, said Arthur, we're going to die
I wish you'd stop saying that, said Ford
It is worth repeating at this point the theories  that  Ford  had come  up  with,  on  his  first  encounter  with human beings, to account for their  peculiar  habit  of  continually  stating  and restating  the  very  very  obvious,  as it 'It's a nice day, or You're very tall, or So this is it, we're going to die
His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep  exercising their lips, their mouths probably seized up
After a few months of observation he had come up  with  a  second theory,  which  was this - If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, their brains start working
In fact, this  second  theory  is  more  literally  true  of  the Belcebron people of Kakrafoon
The  Belcebron  people  used  to  cause  great   resentment   and insecurity  amongst  neighboring  races  by being one of the most enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet  civilizations  in the Galaxy
As a  punishment  for  this  behaviour,  which  was  held  to  be offensively  self  righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal inflicted on  them  that  most  cruel  of  all  social  diseases, telepathy
Consequently,   in   order   to  prevent  themselves
broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds  to anyone  within  a  five  mile  radius, they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and pains,  the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon had suddenly become
Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play host to a Disaster Area concert
The timing of the concert was critical
The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in  order to  hit  the  sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of  the solar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon
The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the  time that   Ford  Prefect  had  completed  his  search  of  the  other compartments of the black ship
He burst back into the cabin
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed  terrifyingly  large  on  the  vision screen,  its  blazing  white  inferno  of  fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged  onwards,  unheeding the  thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel
Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions  of  rabbits  on  a night   road  who  think  that  the  best  way  of  dealing  with approaching headlights is to stare them out
Zaphod span round, wild-eyed
Ford, he said, how many escape capsules are there
None, said Ford
Zaphod gibbered
Did you count them
he yelled
Twice, said Ford, did you manage to raise the  stage  crew  on the radio
Yeah, said Zaphod, bitterly, I said there were a  whole  bunch of people on board, and they said to say `hi' to everybody
Ford goggled
Didn't you tell them who we were
Oh yeah
They said it was a great  honour
That  and  something about a restaurant bill and my executors
Ford pushed Arthur aside and  leaned  forward  over  the  control console
Does none of this function
he said savagely
All overridden
Smash the autopilot
Find it first
Nothing connects
There was a moment's cold silence
Arthur was stumbling round the back  of  the  cabin
He  stopped suddenly
Incidentally, he said, what does teleport mean
Another moment passed
Slowly, the others turned to face him
Probably the wrong moment to ask, said  Arthur,  It's  just  I remember  hearing  you  use the word a short while ago and I only bring it up because
Where, said Ford Prefect quietly, does it say teleport
Well, just over here in fact, said Arthur, pointing at  a  dark control  box  in  the  rear  of  the  cabin, Just under the word `emergency', above the word `system' and beside the  sign  saying `out of order'
In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the  only  action  to follow  was  that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the single small black button set into it
A  six-foot  square  panel  slid  open  beside  it  revealing   a compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new function in life as  an  electrician's  junk  store
Half-
finished  wiring  hung  from  the  ceiling, a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on the floor,  and  the  programming  panel lolled  out  of  the cavity in the wall into which it should have been secured
A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting  the  shipyard  where this  ship  was  being  constructed,  had demanded to know of the works foreman  why  the  hell  they  were  fitting  an  extremely expensive  teleport  into  a  ship  which  only had one important journey to make, and that unmanned
The  foreman  had  explained
that  the  teleport  was available at a ten per cent discount and the accountant  had  explained  that  this  was  immaterial;  the foreman  had  explained that it was the finest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could buy  and  the  accountant had  explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the ship  and  the  accountant  had explained that the ship sported a perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had  explained  that  the accountant  could  go  and  boil  his head and the accountant had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching  him  rapidly from  his left was a knuckle sandwich
After the explanations had
been concluded, work  was  discontinued  on  the  teleport  which subsequently  passed  unnoticed on the invoice as Sund
explns
at five times the price
Hell's donkeys, muttered Zaphod as he  and  Ford  attempted  to sort through the tangle of wiring
After a moment or so Ford told him to stand  back
He  tossed  a coin  into  the  teleport  and  jiggled  a  switch on the lolling
control panel
With  a  crackle  and  spit  of  light,  the  coin vanished
That much of  it  works,  said  Ford,  however,  there  is  no guidance  system
A matter transference teleport without guidance
programming could put you
well, anywhere
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen
Who cares, said Zaphod, we go where we go
And, said Ford, there is no autosystem
We  couldn't  all  go
Someone would have to stay and operate it
A solemn moment shuffled past
The sun loomed larger and larger
Hey, Marvin kid, said Zaphod brightly, how you doing
Very badly I suspect, muttered Marvin
A shortish while later,  the  concert  on  Kakrafoon  reached  an unexpected climax
The black ship with its single morose  occupant  had  plunged  on schedule  into  the  nuclear  furnace  of  the sun
Massive solar
flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling and  in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation  of the moment
Moments before the flare light  reached  Kakrafoon  the  pounding desert  cracked  along  a  deep  faultline
A  huge and hitherto
undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to  the  surface  to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that  flowed  hundreds  of  feet into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side  of the world and back again
Those - very few - who witnessed the  event  and  survived  swear that  the  whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself  over  and fell  back  down
At that precise moment the solar radiation from
the flares filtered through the clouds  of  vaporized  water  and struck the ground
A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert  was  thick with  flowers
The structure of the atmosphere around the planet
was subtly altered
The sun blazed less harshly  in  the  summer, the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more
often,  and  slowly  the  desert  world  of  Kakrafoon  became  a paradise
Even  the  telepathic  power  with which the people of
Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the  force of the explosion
A spokesman for Disaster Area - the  one  who  had  had  all  the environmentalists  shot  - was later quoted as saying that it had been a good gig
Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music
A  few sceptical  scientists  examined  the  records  of the events more
closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast  artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a nearby region of space
Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it
Hangovers  he'd  had, but  never  anything on this scale
This was it, this was the big
one, this was the ultimate pits
Matter  transference  beams,  he decided,  were  not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the
head
Being for the moment unwilling to  move  on  account  of  a  dull stomping  throb  he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought
The  trouble  with  most  forms  of  transport,  he  thought,  is basically  one of them not being worth all the bother
On Earth -
when there had been an Earth, before it was  demolished  to  make way for a new hyperspace bypass - the problem had been with cars
The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky  slime from  out  of  the  ground where it had been safely hidden out of harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke  to fill  the  air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another - particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as a result of this,  very  similar  to  the place  you  had  left,  i
e
covered with tar, full of smoke and
short of fish
And what about matter transference beams
Any form  of  transport which  involved  tearing  you  apart atom by atom, flinging those
atoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back  together again  just  when  they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news
Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent  and  had even  gone  to the lengths of writing songs about it
Here is one
that used regularly to be chanted  by  huge  crowds  outside  the Sirius   Cybernetics  Corporation  Teleport  Systems  factory  on Happi-Werld III: Aldebaran's great, OK, Algol's pretty neat, Betelgeuse's pretty girls, Will knock you off your feet
They'll do anything you like, Real fast and then real slow, But if you have to take me apart to get me there, Then I don't want to go
Singing, Take me apart, take me apart, What a way to roam, And if you have to take me apart to get me there, I'd rather stay at home
Sirius is paved with gold So I've heard it said By nuts who then go on to say See Tau before you're dead
I'll gladly take the high road Or even take the low, But if you have to take me apart to get me there, Then I, for one, won't go
Singing, Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head, And if you try to take me apart to get me there, I'll stay right here in bed
I teleported home one night, With Ron and Sid and Meg, Ron stole Meggie's heart away, And I got Sidney's leg
Arthur felt the waves of pain  slowly  receding,  though  he  was still aware of a dull stomping throb
Slowly, carefully, he stood
up
Can you hear a dull stomping throb
said Ford Prefect
Arthur span round  and  wobbled  uncertainly
Ford  Prefect  was approaching looking red eyed and pasty
Where are we
gasped Arthur
Ford looked around
They were standing in a long curving corridor which  stretched out of sight in both directions
The outer steel
wall - which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they  use  in  schools,  hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued - curved over the tops of their  heads  where  it met  the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered in dark brown hessian wall weave
The floor  was  of  dark  green
ribbed rubber
Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the outer  wall
It was several layers deep, yet through it he could
see pinpoints of distant stars
I think we're in a spaceship of some kind, he said
Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb
Trillian
called Arthur nervously, Zaphod
Ford shrugged
Nowhere about, he said, I've looked
They could  be  anywhere
An  unprogrammed  teleport  can  throw  you  light  years  in any direction
Judging by  the  way  I  feel  I  should  think  we've
travelled a very long way indeed
How do you feel
Bad
Do you think they're
Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and  no way we can do anything about it
Do what I do
What
Don't think about it
Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw  the wisdom  of  it,  tucked  it  up  and  put it away
He took a deep
breath
Footsteps
exclaimed Ford suddenly
Where
That noise
That stomping throb
Pounding feet
Listen
Arthur listened
The noise echoed round the corridor at them from an  indeterminate  distance
It was the muffled sound of pounding
footsteps, and it was noticeably louder
Let's move, said Ford sharply
They both moved  -  in  opposite directions
Not that way, said Ford, that's where they're coming from
No it's not, said Arthur, They're coming from that way
They're not, they're
They both stopped
They both turned
They both listened intently
They both agreed with each other
They both set off into opposite directions again
Fear gripped them
From both directions the noise was getting louder
A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner wall
They ran to it and hurried along it
It was dark,
immensely long and,  as  they  passed  down  it,  gave  them  the impression that it was getting colder and colder
Other corridors
gave off it to the left  and  right,  each  very  dark  and  each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed
They stopped for a moment in alarm
The further down the corridor they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet
They pressed themselves back against the cold wall  and  listened furiously
The  cold,  the  dark and the drumming of disembodied
feet was getting to them badly
Ford shivered,  partly  with  the cold,  but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother
used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle high  to  an  Arcturan  Megagrasshopper:  stories  of dead ships, haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the  obscurer  regions of  deep  space  infested  with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered such  ships;  stories  of
then Ford remembered the brown
hessian wall weave in  the  first  corridor  and  pulled  himself together
However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their
death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay  any  money  you liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave
He grasped Arthur by the
arm
Back the way we came,  he  said  firmly  and  they  started  to retrace their steps
A moment later they leap like startled lizards down  the  nearest corridor  junction  as  the  owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in front of them
Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as  about  two dozen  overweight  men and women pounded past them in track suits panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart  surgeon gibber
Ford Prefect stared after them
Joggers
he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed  away  up and down the network of corridors
Joggers
whispered Arthur Dent
Joggers, said Ford prefect with a shrug
The corridor they were concealed in was not like the  others
It was  very  short,  and ended at a large steel door
Ford examined
it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide
The first thing that hit their eyes was what  appeared  to  be  a coffin
And the next four thousand nine hundred  and  ninety-nine  things that hit their eyes were also coffins
The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic
At  the  far end,  about  three  hundred  yards away an archway let through to
what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied
Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on  to  the floor of the vault
Wild, he said
What's so great about  dead  people
asked  Arthur,  nervously stepping down after him
Dunno, said Ford, Let's find out shall we
On  closer  inspection  the  coffins  seemed  to  be  more   like sarcophagi
They  stood about waist high and were constructed of
what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly  what it  was  -  something  that only appeared to be white marble
The
tops were semi-translucent,  and  through  them  could  dimly  be perceived  the  features  of  their  late and presumably lamented occupants
They were humanoid, and had clearly left the  troubles
of  whatever  world  it  was  they came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be discerned
Rolling slowly round the  floor  between  the  sarcophagi  was  a heavy,  oily  white  gas  which  Arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little atmosphere until  he  discovered that  it also froze his ankles
The sarcophagi too were intensely
cold to the touch
Ford suddenly crouched down beside  one  of  them
He  pulled  a corner  of  his  towel  out  of  his  satchel  and started to rub
furiously at something
Look, there's a plaque on this one,  he  explained  to  Arthur, It's frosted over
He rubbed the frost clear and examined the  engraved  characters
To  Arthur  they  looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on  a  night out,  but  Ford  instantly  recognized  an early form of Galactic Eezeereed
It says `Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven,  Telephone Sanitizer Second Class' - and a serial number
A  telephone  sanitizer
said  Arthur,   a   dead   telephone sanitizer
Best kind
But what's he doing here
Ford peered through the top at the figure within
Not a lot, he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins  of his  which  always  made  people think he'd been overdoing things recently and should try to get some rest
He scampered over to another sarcophagus
A moment's brisk  towel work and he announced:
This one's a dead hairdresser
Hoopy
The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an advertising account executive; the one after that contained a second-hand car salesman, third class
An inspection hatch let into the  floor  suddenly  caught  Ford's attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him
A thought occurred to Arthur
If these are just coffins, he  said,  Why  are  they  kept  so cold
Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway,  said  Ford  tugging  the hatchway  open
The  gas poured down through it
Why in fact is
anyone going to all the  trouble  and  expense  of  carting  five thousand dead bodies through space
Ten thousand, said Arthur,  pointing  at  the  archway  through which the next chamber was dimly visible
Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway
He looked up again
Fifteen thousand, he said, there's another lot down there
Fifteen million, said a voice
That's a lot, said Ford, A lot a lot
Turn around slowly, barked the voice, and put your  hands  up
Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits
Hello
said Ford, turning round slowly, putting  his  hands  up and not making any other move
Why, said Arthur Dent, isn't anyone ever pleased to see us
Standing silhouetted  in  the  doorway  through  which  they  had entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them
His
displeasure was communicated  partly  by  the  barking  hectoring quality  of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them
The designer  of  the
gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush
Make it evil, he'd been told
Make it totally clear  that  this  gun
has  a right end and a wrong end
Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly  for  them
If  that  means  sticking  all  sort  of  spikes  and  prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it
This is not a  gun  for
hanging  over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun for going out and making people miserable with
Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily
The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round  them
As  he  came  into  the  light  they could see his black and gold uniform on which the buttons were so highly  polished  that  they shone  with  an  intensity  that  would  have made an approaching motorist flash his lights in annoyance
He gestured at the door
Out, he said
People who can supply that amount of  fire  power don't  need  to  supply  verbs as well
Ford and Arthur went out,
closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun  and  the buttons
Turning into  the  corridor  they  were  jostled  by  twenty-four oncoming  joggers,  now  showered  and changed, who swept on past them into the vault
Arthur turned to watch them in confusion
Move
screamed their captor
Arthur moved
Ford shrugged and moved
In the vault the joggers went  to  twenty-four  empty  sarcophagi along  the  side  wall,  opened  them,  climbed in, and fell into twenty-four dreamless sleeps
Er, captain
Yes, Number One
Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two
Oh, dear
High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain  stared  out  into the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation
From where he
reclined beneath a wide domed bubble  he  could  see  before  and above  them  the  vast  panorama of stars through which they were moving - a panorama that had thinned  out  noticably  during  the course  of  the  voyage
Turning and looking backwards, over the
vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far  denser  mass of  stars  behind  them which seemed to form almost a solid band
This was the view through the Galactic  centre  from  which  they were  travelling,  and indeed had been travelling for years, at a speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he  knew it  was  terribly fast
It was something approaching the speed of
something or other, or was it three times the speed of  something else
Jolly impressive anyway
He peered into the bright distance
behind the ship, looking for something
He  did  this  every  few minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for
He didn't
let it worry him  though
The  scientist  chaps  had  been  very insistent  that  everything  was  going  to  be perfectly alright
providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their  bit in an orderly fashion
He wasn't panicking
As far as he was  concerned  everything  was going  splendidly
He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy
sponge
It crept back into his mind that he  was  feeling  mildly irritated  about something
Now what was all that about
A slight
cough alerted him to the fact that the ship's first  officer  was still standing nearby
Nice chap, Number One
Not of the very  brightest,  had  the  odd spot  of  difficulty  doing  up  his  shoe  laces, but jolly good
officer material for all that
The Captain wasn't a man to kick a chap  when  he  was  bending over trying to do up his shoe laces,
however long it took him
Not  like  that  ghastly  Number  Two, strutting  about  all  over  the  place,  polishing  his buttons,
issuing reports  every  hour:  Ship's  still  moving,  Captain
Still   on   course,   Captain
Oxygen  levels  still  being maintained, Captain
Give it a miss, was the  Captain's  vote
Ah  yes,  that  was  the  thing  that had been irritating him
He peered down at Number One
Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or  other  about  having found some prisoners
The Captain thought about this
Seemed pretty  unlikely  to  him, but he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way
Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit, he said,  He's always wanted some
Ford Prefect and  Arthur  Dent  trudged  onwards  up  the  ship's apparently  endless  corridors
Number  Two  marched behind them
barking the occasional order about not making any false moves  or trying  any  funny  stuff
They seemed to have passed at least a
mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave
Finally they reached a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it
They entered
To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most  remarkable thing  about  the  ship's  bridge was not the fifty foot diameter hemispherical dome  which  covered  it,  and  through  which  the dazzling  display of stars shone down on them: to people who have eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such  wonders are  commonplace
Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments
that crowded the long circumferential wall around them
To Arthur this  was  exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to
look like, and  to  Ford  it  looked  thoroughly  antiquated:  it confirmed his suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken them back at least a million, if not two  million,  years  before their own time
No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath
The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough  hewn  blue  water crystal  and  was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maximegalon Museum  of  Diseased  Imaginings
An  intestinal
jumble  of  plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave;  the  taps  and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump
As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was  terribly wrong,  and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that Number Two approached it
Captain, sir
he shouted through clenched teeth -  a  difficult trick but he'd had years during which to perfect it
A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim of the monstrous bath
Ah, hello, Number  Two,  said  the  Captain,  waving  a  cheery sponge, having a nice day
Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was
I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven, sir
he yapped
Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion
Er
hello, they said
The Captain beamed at them
So Number Two had really  found  some prisoners
Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a
chap doing what he's best at
Oh, hello there, he said to them, Excuse me  not  getting  up, having  a quick bath
Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then
Look in
the fridge Number one
Certainly sir
It is a curious fact, and one to which no  one  knows  quite  how much  importance  to attach, that something like 85% of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced,  have invented  a  drink  called  jynnan  tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or  more  variations  on the  same phonetic theme
The drinks themselves are not the same,
and vary between the Sivolvian chinanto/mnigs which is ordinary water   server  at  slightly  above  room  temperature,  and  the Gagrakackan tzjin-anthony-ks which  kills  cows  at  a  hundred paces;  and  in  fact  the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they  were all  invented  and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds
What can be made of this fact
It exists in total  isolation
As far  as  any  theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is
right  off  the  graph,  and  yet  it  persists
Old  structural linguists  get  very  angry when young structural linguists go on
about it
Young structural linguists get deeply excited about  it and  stay  up late at night convinced that they are very close to
something  of  profound  importance,  and  end  up  becoming  old structural  linguists  before their time, getting very angry with the young ones
Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided  and
unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs
Number Two stood before  the  Captain's  bathtub  trembling  with frustration
Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir
he squealed
The Captain peered at him in bemusement
Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that
he asked
To get information out of them, sir
To find out why  they  came here
Oh no, no, no, said the Captain, I expect they just dropped in for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you
But sir, they're my prisoners
I must interrogate them
The Captain looked at them doubtfully
Oh all right, he said, if you must
Ask them what they want to drink
A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes
He advanced slowly on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent
All right, you scum, he growled, you  vermin
He  jabbed Ford with the Kill-O-Zap gun
Steady on, Number Two, admonished the Captain gently
What do you want to drink
Number Two screamed
Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me, said Ford, What about you Arthur
Arthur blinked
What
Oh, er, yes, he said
With ice or without
bellowed Number Two
Oh, with please, said Ford
Lemon
Yes please, said Ford, and do you have  any  of  those  little biscuits
You know, the cheesy ones
I'm asking  the  questions
howled  Number  Two,  his  body quaking with apoplectic fury
Er, Number Two
said the Captain softly
Sir
Push off, would you, there's a good chap
I'm trying to  have  a relaxing bath
Number Two's eyes narrowed and  became  what  are  known  in  the Shouting  and  Killing  People  trade  as  cold  slits,  the idea presumably being to give your opponent the  impression  that  you have  lost  your  glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake
Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem
He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin  hard line
Again,  tricky  to know why this is understood as fighting
behaviour
If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal,  you were  suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast,
you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line  rather  than,  as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering fangs
May I remind you sir, hissed Number Two at the  Captain,  that you have now been in that bath for over three years
This final
shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to  a corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror
The Captain squirmed in his bath
He gave  Ford  Prefect  a  lame smile
Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine, he said
Ford slowly lowered his hands
It provoked  no  reaction
Arthur lowered his
Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to  the  bath pedestal
He patted it
Nice, he lied
He wondered if it was safe to grin
Very slowly and carefully, he grinned
It was safe
Er
he said to the Captain
Yes
said the Captain
I wonder, said Ford, could I ask you actually what your job is in fact
A hand tapped him on the shoulder
He span round
It was the first officer
Your drinks, he said
Ah, thank you, said Ford
He  and  Arthur  took  their  jynnan tonnyx
Arthur  sipped  his,  and  was  surprised to discover it
tasted very like a whisky and soda
I mean, I couldn't help noticing, said Ford, also taking a sip, the bodies
In the hold
Bodies
said the Captain in surprise
Ford paused and thought  to  himself
Never  take  anything  for granted,  he  thought
Could it be that the Captain doesn't know
he's got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship
The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him
He also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck
Ford looked around
Number Two was staring at him in the  mirror, but  only  for  an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move
The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling benignly
Bodies
said the Captain again
Ford licked his lips
Yes, he said, All those dead telephone sanitizers and  account executives, you know, down in the hold
The Captain stared at him
Suddenly he threw back  his  head  and laughed
Oh they're not dead, he said, Good Lord no, no they're frozen
They're going to be revived
Ford did something he very rarely did
He blinked
Arthur seemed to come out of a trance
You mean you've got a hold  full  of  frozen  hairdressers
he said
Oh yes, said the  Captain,  Millions  of  them
Hairdressers, tired  TV  producers,  insurance  salesmen,  personnel  officers,
security  guards,   public   relations   executives,   management consultants,  you  name  them
We're  going  to colonize another
planet
Ford wobbled very slightly
Exciting isn't it
said the Captain
What, with that lot
said Arthur
Ah, now don't misunderstand me, said the Captain,  we're  just one  of  the  ships  in the Ark Fleet
We're the `B' Ark you see
Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me
Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath
The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure
Thank you so much my dear fellow
Do  help  yourselves  to  more drinks of course
Ford tossed down his  drink,  took  the  bottle  from  the  first officer's tray and refilled his glass to the top
What, he said, is a `B' Ark
This is, said the Captain, and swished the foamy  water  around joyfully with the duck
Yes, said Ford, but
Well what happened you see was, said the Captain, our  planet, the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed
Doomed
Oh yes
So what everyone  thought  was,  let's  pack  the  whole population  into  some  giant  spaceships  and  go  and settle on
another planet
Having told this much of  his  story,  he  settled  back  with  a satisfied grunt
You mean a less doomed one
promoted Arthur
What did you say dear fellow
A less doomed planet
You were going to settle on
Are going to settle on, yes
So it was decided  to  build  three ships,  you  see, three Arks in Space, and
I'm not boring you
am I
No, no, said Ford firmly, it's fascinating
You know it's  delightful,  reflected  the  Captain,  to  have someone else to talk to for a change
Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled  back  on  the  mirror,  like  a  pair  of  flies briefly distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat
Trouble with a long journey like this, continued  the  Captain, is  that  you  end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly boring because half the time you know what you're  going to say next
Only half the time
asked Arthur in surprise
The Captain thought for a moment
Yes, about half I'd say
Anyway - where's the soap
He  fished around and found it
Yes, so anyway, he resumed, the idea was that into  the  first ship,  the  `A'  ship,  would  go  all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the  achievers;  and into  the third, or `C' ship, would go all the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things, and  then  into  the `B'  ship - that's us - would go everyone else, the middlemen you see
He smiled happily at them
And we were sent off first, he concluded, and hummed  a  little bathing tune
The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him  by  one of  his world's most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was currently asleep in  hold  thirty-six  some  nine  hundred  yards behind  them)  covered  what would otherwise have been an awkward moment of silence
Ford  and  Arthur  shuffled  their  feet  and
furiously avoided each other's eyes
Er
said Arthur after a moment, what exactly  was  it  that was wrong with your planet then
Oh, it was doomed, as I said, said the Captain, Apparently  it was  going  to  crash  into the sun or something
Or maybe it was
that the moon was going to crash into us
Something of the  kind
Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was
Oh, said the first officer suddenly, I thought it was that the planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot piranha bees
Wasn't that it
Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard  light  that only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in
That's not what I was told
he hissed, My  commanding  officer told  me  that  the entire planet was in imminent danger of being
eaten by an enormous mutant star goat
Oh really
said Ford Prefect
Yes
A monstrous creature from the pit  of  hell  with  scything teeth  ten  thousand  miles  long, breath that would boil oceans,
claws that could tear continents from  their  roots,  a  thousand eyes  that  burned  like  the sun, slavering jaws a million miles across, a monster such as you have never
never
ever
And they made sure they  sent  you  lot  off  first  did  they
inquired Arthur
Oh yes, said the Captain, well everyone said,  very  nicely  I thought,  that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a  good haircut and where the phones were clean
Oh yes, agreed Ford, I can see that would be  very  important
And the other ships, er
they followed on after you did they
For a moment the Captain did not answer
He twisted round in  his bath  and  gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards
the bright galactic centre
He squinted  into  the  inconceivable distance
Ah
Well it's funny you should say that, he  said  and  allowed himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, because curiously enough
we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years  ago
but they must be behind us somewhere
He peered off into the distance again
Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown
Unless of course, he said softly, they were eaten by the  goat
Ah yes
said the Captain with a  slight  hesitancy  creeping into  his  voice,  the  goat
His eyes passed over the solid
shapes of the instruments and computers that  lined  the  bridge
They  winked  away innocently at him
He stared out at the stars, but none of them said a word
He glanced at his first and  second
officers,  but  they  seemed  lost  in  their  own thoughts for a moment
He glanced at Ford Prefect who  raised  his  eyebrows  at
him
It's a funny thing you know, said the Captain at last, but now that I actually come to tell the story to someone else
I mean
does it strike you as odd Number Two
Errrrrrrrrrrr
said Number Two
Well, said Ford, I can see that you've got  a  lot  of  things you're going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet
Ah, well that's a little difficult you see, said  the  Captain, because   our  trajectory  thingy  was  preset  before  we  left Golgafrincham, I think partly because  I'm  not  very  good  with figures
You mean we're stuck here on this ship
exclaimed Ford suddenly losing patience with the whole charade, When are you meant to be
reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing
Oh, we're nearly there I think, said the Captain,  any  second now
It's  probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact
Oh, I don't know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it
So we're actually going to land in a minute
Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land  as  such,  no
er
What are you talking about
said Ford sharply
Well, said the Captain,  picking  his  way  through  the  words carefully,  I  think as far as I can remember we were programmed to crash on it
Crash
shouted Ford and Arthur
Er, yes, said the Captain, yes, it's all part of  the  plan  I think
There  was  a  terribly  good reason for it which I can't
quite remember at the moment
It was something  to  with
er
Ford exploded
You're a load of useless bloody loonies
he shouted
Ah yes, that was it, beamed the Captain, that was the reason
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say  about  the planet  of  Golgafrincham:  It  is  a  planet with an ancient and mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and  occasionally  green with  the  blood  of those who sought in times gone by to conquer her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry air  heady  with  the  scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks  and  nourish  the  dark  and  musty lichens   beneath;  a  land  of  fevered  brows  and  intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the  lichens;  a land  also  of  cool  and  shaded thoughts amongst those who have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath;  a land  also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and of the spirit
This was its history
And  in  all  this  ancient  and  mysterious  history,  the  most mysterious  figures  of all were without doubt those of the Great Circling Poets of Arium
These Circling Poets  used  to  live  in
remote  mountain  passes  where  they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at them
And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away and  get  on  with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock-throwing business, they would  suddenly  stop, and  then  break  into  one  of the seven hundred and ninety-four great  Song  Cycles  of  Vassilian
These  songs  were  all   of
extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all fell into exactly the same pattern
The first part of each song would tell how there once went  forth from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four horses
The princes, who are of course  brave,  noble  and  wise,
travel widely in distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea  with  weird  gods  and  rescue  beautiful monsters  from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and that  their  wanderings  are therefore accomplished
The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of all  their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back
All this lay in the planet's remote  past
It  was,  however,  a descendant  of  one  of  these  eccentric  poets who invented the
spurious tales of impending doom  which  enabled  the  people  of Golgafrincham  to  rid  themselves  of an entire useless third of their population
The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home  and
lived  full,  rich  and  happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped  out  by  a  virulent  disease  contracted  from  a   dirty telephone
That night the ship crash-landed on to an  utterly  insignificant little  green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end  of  the Western spiral arm of the Galaxy
In  the  hours  preceding  the  crash  Ford  Prefect  had  fought furiously  but  in  vain  to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre-ordained flight path
It had quickly become apparent to
him  that  the  ship  had  been  programmed to convey its payload safely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to  cripple  itself beyond repair in the process
Its  screaming,  blazing  descent  through  the  atmosphere   had stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp  had  left  its crew  only  a  few  hours  of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began  to settle  almost  at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime
Once or twice during the  night  it  was  starkly
silhouetted  against the sky as burning meteors - the detritus of its descent - flashed across the sky
In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene  roaring  gurgle and sank for ever into the stinking depths
When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin  watery  light over  a  vast  area  heaving  with  wailing  hairdressers, public relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way desperately to dry land
A less strong minded sun would probably have gone  straight  back down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and after a while the influence of its warming  rays  began  to  have some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures
Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp  in the  night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands  and as  the  day  wore  on  they  crawled  out  over  the surrounding countryside, each looking for a few square feet of  solid  ground on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal
Two figures moved further afield
From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent  watched  the horror of which they could not feel a part
Filthy dirty trick to pull, muttered Arthur
Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged
An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought, he said
Why can't people just  learn  to  live  together  in  peace  and harmony
said Arthur
Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh
Forty-two
he said with a malicious grin,  No,  doesn't  work
Never mind
Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing  nothing  to indicate  the  contrary,  realized  that  it  would  be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened
What do you think will happen to them  all
he  said  after  a while
In an infinite Universe anything can happen, said  Ford,  Even survival
Strange but true
A curious look came  into  his  eyes  as  they  passed  over  the landscape  and  then  settles  again on the scene of misery below them
I think they'll manage for a while, he said
Arthur looked up sharply
Why do you say that
he said
Ford shrugged
Just a hunch, he said, and refused to be drawn to  any  further questions
Look, he said suddenly
Arthur followed his pointing finger
Down amongst  the  sprawling masses  a figure was moving - or perhaps lurching would be a more
accurate description
He appeared to be carrying something on his shoulder
As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he
seemed to wave whatever the something was at them  in  a  drunken fashion
After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a
heap
Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him
Movie camera, said Ford
Recording the historic movement
Well, I don't know about you, said Ford again after  a  moment, but I'm off
He sat a while in silence
After a while this seemed to require comment
Er, when you say you're off, what do  you  mean  exactly
said Arthur
Good question, said Ford, I'm getting total silence
Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was  twiddling  with knobs  on  a small box
Ford had already introduced this box as a
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently  and not  pursued  the  matter
In his mind the Universe still divided
into two parts - the Earth, and everything else
The Earth having been  demolished  to  make  way for a new hyperspace bypass meant
that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home
Sub-Etha  Sens-O-Matics  belonged  firmly  in  the
everything else category
Not a sausage, said Ford, shaking the thing
Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at  the primitive  world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth sausage
Would you believe, said Ford in exasperation, that  there  are no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted tip
Are you listening to me
What
said Arthur
We're in trouble, said Ford
Oh, said Arthur
This sounded like month-old news to him
Until we pick up anything on  this  machine,  said  Ford,  our chances of getting off this planet are zero
It may be some freak
standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field  -  in  which case  we  just  travel  round  and  round  till  we  find a clear reception area
Coming
He picked up his gear and strode off
Arthur looked down the hill
The man with the  movie  camera  had struggled  back  up  to  his feet just in time to film one of his
colleagues collapsing
Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford
I trust you had a pleasant meal
said Zarniwoop to  Zaphod  and Trillian  as  they  rematerialized  on the bridge of the starship
Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor
Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him
You, he spat
He staggered to his feet and stomped off to  find a chair to slump into
He found one and slumped into it
I  have  programmed  the   computer   with   the   Improbability Coordinates  pertinent  to our journey, said Zarniwoop, we will arrive there very shortly
Meanwhile, why  don't  you  relax  and
prepare yourself for the meeting
Zaphod said nothing
He got up again and marched over to a  small cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit
He took
a long pull at it
And when this is all done, said Zaphod  savagely,  it's  done, alright
I'm  free  to go and do what the hell I like and lie on
beaches and stuff
It depends what transpires from the meeting, said Zarniwoop
Zaphod, who is this man
said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her feet, What's he doing here
Why's he on our ship
He's a very stupid man, said Zaphod, who wants to meet the man who rules the Universe
Ah, said Trillian taking the bottle  from  Zaphod  and  helping herself, a social climber
The major problem - one of the  major  problems,  for  there  are several - one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who  manages  to  get people to let them do it to them
To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it
To summarize the  summary:  anyone  who  is  capable  of  getting themselves  made  President should on no account be allowed to do the job
To summarize the summary of the summary:  people  are  a
problem
And so this is the situation we find: a  succession  of  Galactic Presidents  who  so  much  enjoy  the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that they're not
And somewhere in the shadows behind them - who
Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to
On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle  of  nowhere  in particular - nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which  only  six men in this galaxy have a key - it was raining
It was bucketing down, and had been for hours
It beat the top of the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped
a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath
The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated  iron  roof  of  the small  shack  that  stood  in the middle of this patch of scrubby land
It obliterated the small rough pathway that  led  from  the
shack  down  to  the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there
The noise of the rain on the roof  of  the  shack  was  deafening within,  but  went  largely  unnoticed  by  its  occupant,  whose attention was otherwise engaged
He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured  hair  that was damp from the leaking roof
His clothes were shabby, his back
was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed
In his shack was an old  beaten-up  armchair,  an  old  scratched table,  an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small but warm
There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten  cat,  and  this was  currently  the  focus  of  the  man's attention
He bent his
shambling form over it
Pussy, pussy, pussy, he said, coochicoochicoochicoo
pussy want his fish
Nice piece of fish
pussy want it
The  cat  seemed  undecided  on  the  matter
It  pawed   rather condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and
then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor
Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think, said the man
Doubt crept into his voice
I imagine this is what will happen, he said,  but  how  can  I tell
He proffered the fish again
Pussy think, he said, eat fish or not eat fish
I think it  is better if I don't get involved
He sighed
I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so  who am I to judge
He left the fish on the floor for the cat,  and  retired  to  his seat
Ah, I seem to see you eating it, he said at last,  as  the  cat exhausted  the  entertainment  possibilities of the speck of dust and pounced on to the fish
I like it when I see you eat the fish, said the  man,  because in my mind you will waste away if you don't
He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the  stub  of  a pencil
He  held one in one hand and the other in the other, and
experimented with the different ways of bringing  them  together
He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper, then next to the paper
He tried wrapping  the  paper  round  the
pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then he tried rubbing  the  sharp  end  of  the  pencil against  the paper
It made a mark, and he was delighted with the
discovery, as he was every day
He picked  up  another  piece  of paper  from  the table
This had a crossword on it
He studied it
briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest
He tried sitting on one of his hands and  was  intrigued  by  the feel of the bones of his hip
Fish come from far away, he said, or so  I'm  told
Or  so  I imagine  I'm  told
When the men come, or when in my mind the men
come in their six black ships, do they come  in  your  mind  too
What do you see pussy
He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with  getting  the fish  down  as  rapidly  as  possible  than  it  was  with  these speculations
And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions
What  do their  voices mean to you
Perhaps you just think they're singing
songs to you
He reflected on this, and  saw  the  flaw  in  the supposition
Perhaps they are singing songs to you, he  said,  and  I  just think they're asking me questions
He paused again
Sometimes he would pause for days, just  to  see what it was like
Do you think they came today
he said, I do
There's  mud  on the  floor,  cigarettes  and whisky on the table, fish on a plate
for you and a memory  of  them  in  my  mind
Hardly  conclusive evidence  I  know,  but  then all evidence is circumstantial
And
look what else they've left me
He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it
Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator
He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to sleep  and  the rain outside continued to pour
Eventually he put
the calculator aside
I think I must be right in thinking they ask me  questions,  he said,  To  come  all that way and leave all these things for the privilege  of  singing  songs  to  you  would  be  very   strange behaviour
Or so it seems to me
Who can tell, who can tell
From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with  a  spill from the stove
He inhaled deeply and sat back
I think I saw another ship in the sky today, he said  at  last
A  big  white one
I've never seen a big white one, just the six black ones
And the six green ones
And the others who  say  they
come  from  so far away
Never a big white one
Perhaps six small black ones can look like one big  white  one  at  certain  times
Perhaps  I  would  like  a  glass of whisky
Yes, that seems more likely
He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by  the mattress
He  poured in a measure from his whisky bottle
He sat
again
Perhaps some other people are coming to see me, he said
A hundred yards away, pelted by  the  torrential  rain,  lay  the Heart of Gold
Its hatchway opened, and three  figures  emerged,  huddling  into themselves to keep the rain off their faces
In there
shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain
Yes, said Zarniwoop
That shack
Yes
Weird, said Zaphod
But it's in the middle of nowhere, said Trillian, we must have come  to  the  wrong  place
You  can't rule the Universe from a
shack
They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet  through, at the door
They knocked
They shivered
The door opened
Hello
said the man
Ah, excuse me, said Zarniwoop, I have reason to believe
Do you rule the Universe
said Zaphod
The man smiled at him
I try not to, he said, Are you wet
Zaphod looked at him in astonishment
Wet
he cried, Doesn't it look as if we're wet
That's how it looks to me, said the  man,  but  how  you  feel about  it  might  be  an altogether different matter
If you feel
warmth makes you dry, you'd better come in
They went in
They  looked  around  the  tiny  shack,  Zarniwoop  with   slight distaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight
Hey, er
said Zaphod, what's your name
The man looked at them doubtfully
I don't know
Why, do you think I should have one
It seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name
He invited Trillian to sit in the chair
He sat on  the  edge  of the  chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod
lay on the mattress
Wowee
said Zaphod, the seat of power
He tickled the cat
Listen, said Zarniwoop, I must ask you some questions
Alright, said the man kindly, you can sing to my  cat  if  you like
Would he like that
asked Zaphod
You'd better ask him, said the man
Does he talk
said Zaphod
I have no memory of him talking, said the man, but I  am  very unreliable
Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket
Now, he said, you do rule the Universe, do you
How can I tell
said the man
Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper
How long have you been doing this
Ah, said the man, this is a question about the past is it
Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement
This wasn't  exactly  what he had been expecting
Yes, he said
How can I tell, said the man, that the past  isn't  a  fiction designed  to  account  for  the  discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind
Zarniwoop stared at him
The steam began to rise from his  sodden clothes
So you answer all questions like this
he said
The man answered quickly
I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say things
More I cannot say
Zaphod laughed happily
I'll drink to that, he said and pulled out the bottle  of  Janx spirit
He  leaped  up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the
Universe, who took it with pleasure
Good on you, great ruler, he said, tell it like it is
No, listen to me, said Zarniwoop, people come to you do  they
In ships
I think so, said the man
He handed the bottle to Trillian
And they ask you, said Zarniwoop, to take decisions for  them
About  people's lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars, about everything going on out there in the Universe
Out there
said the man, out where
Out there
said Zarniwoop pointing at the door
How can you tell there's  anything  out  there,  said  the  man politely, the door's closed
The rain continued to pound the roof
Inside  the  shack  it  was warm
But  you  know  there's  a  whole  Universe  out  there
cried Zarniwoop
You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they
don't exist
The ruler of  the  Universe  thought  for  a  long  while  whilst Zarniwoop quivered with anger
You're very sure of your facts, he said at  last,  I  couldn't trust  the thinking of a man who takes the Universe - if there is one - for granted
Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent
I only decide about my Universe, continued the man quietly
My Universe is my eyes and my ears
Anything else is hearsay
But don't you believe in anything
The man shrugged and picked up his cat
I don't understand what you mean, he said
You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours affects  the  lives  and fates of millions of people
This is all
monstrously wrong
I don't know
I've never met all these people you speak of
And neither,  I  suspect, have you
They only exist in words we hear
It is folly to say you know what is happening  to  other  people
Only  they  know, if they exist
They have their own Universes of their own eyes and ears
Trillian said: I think I'm just popping outside for a moment
She left and walked into the rain
Do you believe other people exist
insisted Zarniwoop
I have no opinion
How can I say
I'd better see what's up with Trillian, said Zaphod and slipped out
Outside, he said to her: I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah
Very good, said Trillian
They walked off into the rain
Inside, Zarniwoop continued
But don't you understand that people live or die on your word
The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could
When he heard  the faint sound of the ship's engines starting he spoke to
cover it
It's nothing to do with me, he said, I am  not  involved  with people
The Lord knows I am not a cruel man
Ah
barked Zarniwoop, you  say  `The  Lord'
You  believe  in something
My cat, said the man benignly, picking it up and  stroking  it, I call him The Lord
I am kind to him
Alright, said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, How  do  you know  he  exists
How  do  you  know he knows you to be kind, or
enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness
I don't, said the man with a smile, I have no idea
It  merely pleases  me  to  behave  in a certain way to what appears to be a
cat
Do you behave any differently
Please, I think I am tired
Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about
Where are the other two
he said suddenly
What other two
said the ruler of the Universe,  settling  back into his chair and refilling his whisky glass
Beeblebrox and the girl
The two who were here
I remember no one
The past is a fiction to account for
Stuff it, snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into  the  rain
There was  no  ship
The rain continued to churn the mud
There was no
sign to show where the ship had been
He hollered into the  rain
He turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked
The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in  his  chair
After  a while  he  played  with  the  pencil  and the paper again and was
delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the  one  on the  other
Various noises continued outside, but he didn't know
whether they were real or not
He then talked to his table for  a week to see how it would react
The stars came out that night, dazzling in their  brilliance  and clarity
Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any
means of judging and finally stopped to rest
The night was  cool and  balmy,  the  air  pure,  the  Sub-Etha  Sens
O
Matic totally
silent
A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical  calm  which combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to  soothe  their jangled spirits
Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than
he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder  if  this was  the  most  beautiful he had ever seen
All that day they had
passed through rolling green hills and  valleys,  richly  covered with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees, the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept  them  cool,  and Ford  Prefect  had  checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic at less and less  frequent  intervals,  and  had  exhibited  less  and   less annoyance  at its continued silence
He was beginning to think he
liked it here
Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and  comfortably in  the  open  and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling refreshed but hungry
Ford had stuffed some  small  rolls
into  his  satchel  at  Milliways  and they breakfasted off those before moving on
So far they had wandered purely at random, but  now  they  struck out  firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have some clear idea  of  where  they  had come from and where they were going
Shortly before noon they had  their  first  indication  that  the world  they  had  landed  on  was  not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them
It  vanished  at
the  moment  they  both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious  to  see  them  but  not alarmed
Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and
ten minutes after that another
A minute later they stumbled into a  wide  clearing  and  stopped short
Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of  about two  dozen  men and women
They stood still and quiet facing Ford
and Arthur
Around some of the women huddled some small  children and  behind  the  group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings
made of mud and branches
Ford and Arthur held their breath
The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet  high,  they all  stooped  forward  slightly,  had  longish  arms  and  lowish foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared  intently at the strangers
Seeing that they carried no weapons  and  made  no  move  towards them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly
For a while the two groups simply stared at each  other,  neither side   making  any  move
The  natives  seemed  puzzled  by  the
intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations
For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen
After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened
Hello, he said
The women drew their children slightly closer to them
The men made hardly any discernible  move  and  yet  their  whole disposition  made it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome
One of the men, who had been standing  slightly  forward  of  the rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader, stepped forward
His face was quiet and calm, almost serene
Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh, he said quietly
This caught Arthur by surprise
He had grown so used to receiving an  instantaneous  and  unconscious  translation of everything he
heard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased  to be  aware  of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didn't seem to  be  working
Vague  shadows  of
meaning  had  flickered  at  the  back of his mind, but there was nothing he could get any firm grasp on
He guessed, correctly  as
it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments  of  language,  and  that  the  Babel  Fish  was therefore  powerless  to  help
He  glanced  at  Ford,  who  was
infinitely more experienced in these matters
I think, said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, he's asking us if we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village
A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm this
Ruurgggghhhh  urrgggh;  urgh  urgh  (uh  ruh)   rruurruuh   ug, continued the man-creature
The general gist, said Ford, as far as I can make out, is that we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we would walk round his village rather than through it  it  would make them all very happy
So what do we do
I think we make them happy, said Ford
Slowly and watchfully they walked  round  the  perimeter  of  the clearing
This  seemed to go down very well with the natives who
bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business
Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood
A  few hundred  yards  past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small
pile  of  fruit  lying  in  their  path  -  berries  that  looked remarkably  like  raspberries  and blackberries, and pulpy, green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears
So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries  they  had seen, though the trees and bushed were laden with them
Look at it this way, Ford Prefect had said, fruit and  berries on  strange  planets  either  make  you  live  or  make  you die
Therefore the point at which to start toying with  them  is  when you're  going  to  die if you don't
That way you stay ahead
The
secret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food
They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion
It looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger
Look at it this way, said Ford, er
Yes
said Arthur
I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it, said Ford
The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the  pulp  skins  of  the  things which looked like pears
The things which looked like raspberries
and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur  had  ever seen, even in ice cream commercials
Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards
he said
Maybe that's what they want us to do
Alright, look at it this way
Sounds good so far
It's there for us to eat
Either it's good or it's  bad,  either they  want  to  feed us or to poison us
If it's poisonous and we
don't eat it they'll just attack us some other way
If  we  don't eat, we lose out either way
I like the way you're thinking, said Ford, Now eat one
Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like pears
I always thought that about the  Garden  of  Eden  story,  said Ford
Eh
Garden of Eden
Tree
Apple
That bit, remember
Yes of course I do
Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple
Surprise
surprise, they eat it  and  he  leaps  out  from  behind  a  bush shouting  `Gotcha'
It wouldn't have made any difference if they
hadn't eaten it
Why not
Because if you're dealing with somebody  who  has  the  sort  of mentality  which  likes  leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won't  give  up
They'll
get you in the end
What are you talking about
Never mind, eat the fruit
You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden
Eat the fruit
Sounds quite like it too
Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear
It's a pear, he said
A few moments later, when they had eaten the  lot,  Ford  Prefect turned round and called out
Thank you
Thank you very much, he called, you're very kind
They went on their way
For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they  kept  on finding  the  occasional  gift  of fruit lying in their path, and though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of  a  native  man- creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact
They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone
The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was where the sea started
Having no pressing calls on their time  they  built  a  raft  and crossed  the  sea
It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles
wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing,  landing  in  a country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left
Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a  while  at  least they  were  able  to  cope  with  the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding  to  ignore  them
When  the  craving  for
company  became  too  great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they were happy to feel  that  the  Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles behind them
Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic more often again
Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was
so faint and from such enormous distance that  it  depressed  him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken
On a whim they turned northwards
After weeks of travelling  they came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it
This time
it was harder going,  the  climate  was  getting  colder
Arthur suspected  a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect - the increasing
difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense  of  purpose that was otherwise lacking
He strode onwards relentlessly
Their journey northwards  brought  them  into  steep  mountainous terrain  of breathtaking sweep and beauty
The vast, jagged, snow
covered peaks ravished their senses
The cold began to bite  into their bones
They wrapped themselves in  animal  skins  and  furs  which  Ford Prefect  acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex-Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in  the  Hills  of Hunian
The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all  on  the  make, because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a form of devotional discipline are,  frankly,  sensational  -  and extraordinary  numbers  of  monks leave the Order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives
Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a while and smiling
After a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from  out of  the  trees  and  watch him cautiously
Ford would continue to
smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he  would  seem to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to embrace all of creation
A wonderful quietness would  descend  on
the  surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from this transfigured man
Slowly the deer would  approach,  step  by
step,  until  it  was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it and break its neck
Pheromone control, he said it was, you just have to  know  how to generate the right smell
A few days after landing in this  mountainous  land  they  hit  a coastline  which swept diagonally before them from the south-west to the north-east,  a  coastline  of  monumental  grandeur:  deep majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice - fjords
For two further days they scrambled and climbed  over  the  rocks and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty
Arthur
yelled Ford suddenly
It was the afternoon of the second day
Arthur was sitting  on  a high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the
craggy promontories
Arthur
yelled Ford again
Arthur looked to  where  Ford's  voice  had  come  from,  carried faintly in the wind
Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur  found  him  there crouching  by  the  solid  wall  of  blue  ice
He was tense with
excitement - his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's
Look, he said, look
Arthur looked
He saw the solid wall of blue ice
Yes, he said, it's a glacier
I've already seen it
No, said Ford, you've looked  at  it,  you  haven't  seen  it
Look
Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice
Arthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows
Move back from it, insisted Ford, look again
Arthur moved back and looked again
No, he said, and shrugged
What am I supposed  to  be  looking for
And suddenly he saw it
You see it
He saw it
His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it  hadn't  got anything  to say yet and shut it again
His brain then started to
contend with the problem of what  his  eyes  told  it  they  were looking  at,  but  in  doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again
Once more gathering up  the  jaw,
his  brain  lost  control  of  his  left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion
For a second or so the brain  tried
to  catch  the  left  hand  without  letting  go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in  the  ice, which  is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully to the ground
The thing that had been causing  all  this  neural  upset  was  a network  of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface
Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the
solid  shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three feet  high;  and  for  those,  like  Arthur,  who  couldn't  read Magrathean  there  was  above  the  letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice
It was an old face, thin  and  distinguished,  careworn  but  not unkind
It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on
A thin whine filled the air
It whirled and  howled  through  the trees  upsetting  the squirrels
A few birds flew off in disgust
The noise danced and skittered round the clearing
It whooped, it rasped, it generally offended
The  Captain,  however,  regarded  the  lone  bagpiper  with   an indulgent  eye
Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once
he had got over  the  loss  of  his  gorgeous  bath  during  that unpleasantness  in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial
A hollow had been scooped
out  of  a  large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants  sloshed  water over  him
Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they
hadn't yet worked out a way of heating it
Never mind, that would come,  and  in  the  meantime  search  parties  were scouring the
countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably  one  in  a nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - perfection
To
those who said that they had  a  feeling  soap  wasn't  found  in mines,  the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this  possibility  had been reluctantly acknowledged
No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about  it  was that  when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite,  and  when  in  the  fullness  of  time   the   cry   came reverberating  across  the  hills  that  the  soap  mine had been located and was producing five hundred cakes a day  it  would  be more pleasant still
It was very important to have things to look
forward to
Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the  bagpipes, increasing  the  Captain's  already  considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop
That  was  something
he looked forward to as well
What else was pleasant, he asked himself
Well, so  many  things: the  red  and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching;
the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple  of  hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny  telephones  lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath
The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all  the  time (or  indeed  at all) was six phones that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all)
Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of  people slowly  assembling  in  the  clearing  around  him  to  watch the afternoon committee meeting
The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on  the  beak
The afternoon committee meetings were his favourite
Other eyes watched the assembling crowds
High in a tree  on  the edge  of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from
foreign climes
After his six  month  journey  he  was  lean  and healthy,  his  eyes  gleamed,  he  wore a reindeer-skin coat; his
beard was as thick and his face  as  bronzed  as  a  country-rock singer's
He and Arthur Dent  had  been  watching  the  Golgafrinchans  for almost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit
The clearing was now full
Hundreds  of  men  and  women  lounged around,  chatting,  eating  fruit,  playing  cards  and generally
having a fairly relaxed time of it
Their track  suits  were  now all  dirty  and  even  torn, but they all had immaculately styled
hair
Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their track  suits  full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be
some form of insulation against the coming  winter
Ford's  eyes narrowed
They couldn't be interested in botany of a sudden could
they
In the middle of these  speculations  the  Captain's  voice  rose above the hubbub
Alright, he said, I'd like to call this meeting to  some  sort of  order  if  that's  at  all  possible
Is  that  alright with
everybody
He smiled genially
In a  minute
When  you're  all ready
The talking gradually died away and  the  clearing  fell  silent, except  for  the  bagpiper  who  seemed  to  be  in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own
A few  of  those  in  his
immediate  vicinity  threw  some  leaves to him
If there was any reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment
A small group of people had clustered round the Captain  and  one of  them  was clearly beginning to speak
He did this by standing
up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance  as if  to  signify  to  the  crowd  that  he would be with them in a minute
The crowd of course were riveted and all  turned  their  eyes  on him
A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be  the  right dramatic moment to make his entry
The man turned to speak
Ford dropped down out of the tree
Hi there, he said
The crowd swivelled round
Ah my dear fellow, called out the Captain, Got any matches  on you
Or a lighter
Anything like that
No, said Ford, sounding a little deflated
It wasn't what  he'd prepared
He  decided  he'd  better  be a little stronger on the
subject
No I haven't, he continued, No matches
Instead  I  bring  you news
Pity, said the Captain, We've all run out you see
Haven't had a hot bath in weeks
Ford refused to be headed off
I bring you news, he said, of a discovery that might  interest you
Is it on the agenda
snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted
Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile
Now, come on, he said
Well I'm sorry, said  the  man  huffily,  but  speaking  as  a management  consultant  of many years' standing, I must insist on the importance of observing the committee structure
Ford looked round the crowd
He's mad you know, he said, this is a prehistoric planet
Address the chair
snapped the management consultant
There isn't chair, explained Ford, there's only a rock
The management consultant decided that  testiness  was  what  the situation now called for
Well, call it a chair, he said testily
Why not call it a rock
asked Ford
You  obviously  have  no  conception,   said   the   management consultant,  not  abandoning  testiness  in  favour  of  good old fashioned hauteur, of modern business methods
And you have no conception of where you are, said Ford
A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it
Shut up, you two, she said, I want to table a motion
You mean boulder a motion, tittered a hairdresser
Order, order
yapped the management consultant
Alright, said Ford, let's see how you are doing
He  plonked himself  down  on  the  ground  to see how long he could keep his
temper
The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise
I would like to call to order, he said  pleasantly,  the  five hundred  and  seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee of Fintlewoodlewix
Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again
This is futile, he exclaimed, five hundred  and  seventy-three committee meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet
If you would care, said the girl with the strident  voice,  to examine the agenda sheet
Agenda rock, trilled the hairdresser happily
Thank you, I've made that point, muttered Ford
you
will
see
continued the girl  firmly,  that we  are  having  a report from the hairdressers' Fire Development
Sub-Committee today
Oh
ah - said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which  is recognized  the  whole  Galaxy  over  as  meaning  Er, will next
Tuesday do
Alright, said Ford, rounding on him, what have you done
What are you going to do
What are your thoughts on fire development
Well I don't know, said the hairdresser, All they gave me  was a couple of sticks
So what have you done with them
Nervously, the hairdresser fished  in  his  track  suit  top  and handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford
Ford held them up for all to see
Curling tongs, he said
The crowd applauded
Never mind, said Ford, Rome wasn't burnt in a day
The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but they loved it nevertheless
They applauded
Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course, said  the girl,  When  you've  been  in marketing as long as I have you'll know that before any new product can be developed it  has  to  be properly  researched
We've got to find out what people want from
fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them
The crowd were tense
They  were  expecting  something  wonderful from Ford
Stick it up your nose, he said
Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,  insisted the girl, Do people want fire that can be applied nasally
Do you
Ford asked the crowd
Yes
shouted some
No
shouted others happily
They didn't know, they just thought it was great
And the wheel, said the Captain, What about this wheel thingy
It sounds a terribly interesting project
Ah, said the marketing  girl,  Well,  we're  having  a  little difficulty there
Difficulty
exclaimed Ford,  Difficulty
What  do  you  mean, difficulty
It's  the  single  simplest  machine  in  the entire
Universe
The marketing girl soured him with a look
Alright, Mr Wiseguy, she said, you're so clever, you  tell  us what colour it should have
The crowd went wild
One up to the home team, they thought
Ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again
Almighty Zarquon, he said, have none of you done anything
As if in answer to his question there was  a  sudden  clamour  of noise  from  the  entrance  to  the  clearing
The crowd couldn't
believe the  amount  of  entertainment  they  were  getting  this afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of their  Golgafrincham  3rd  Regiment  dress  uniforms
About  half  of  them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now carried spears which they struck together as they  marched
They
looked  bronzed,  healthy,  and utterly exhausted and bedraggled
They clattered to a halt and banged to  attention
One  of  them fell over and never moved again
Captain, sir
cried Number Two - for  he  was  their  leader  - Permission to report sir
Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that
Find any hot springs
said the Captain despondently
No sir
Thought you wouldn't
Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath
We have discovered another continent
When was this
It lies across the sea
said Number Two, narrowing his  eyes significantly, to the east
Ah
Number Two turned to face the crowd
He raised his gun above  his head
This is going to be great, thought the crowd
We have declared war on it
Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the  clearing - this was beyond all expectation
Wait a minute, shouted Ford Prefect, wait a minute
He leapt to his feet and demanded silence
After a while  he  got it,  or  at  least  the  best silence he could hope for under the
circumstances: the  circumstances  were  that  the  bagpiper  was spontaneously composing a national anthem
Do we have to have the piper
demanded Ford
Oh yes, said the Captain, we've given him a grant
Ford considered opening this  idea  up  for  debate  but  quickly decided that that way madness lay
Instead he slung a well judged
rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two
War
he said
Yes
Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect
On the next continent
Yes
Total warfare
The war to end all wars
But there's no one even living there yet
Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point
Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed
In this respect  his  eyes were  like  a  couple  of mosquitos that hover purposefully three
inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats or rolled newspapers
I know that, he said, but there will be one day
So  we  have left an open-ended ultimatum
What
And blown up a few military installations
The Captain leaned forward out of his bath
Military installations Number Two
he said
For a moment the eyes wavered
Yes sir, well  potential  military  installations
Alright
trees
The moment of uncertainty passed - his eyes flickered like  whips over his audience
And, he roared, we interrogated a gazelle
He flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm  and  marched off  through  the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the ecstatic crowd
A few steps was all  he  managed  before  he  was
caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the clearing
Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together
So what else have you done
he inquired after the  celebrations had died down
We have started a culture, said the marketing girl
Oh yes
said Ford
Yes
One of our film producers is already making  a  fascinating documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area
They're not cavemen
They look like cavemen
Do they live in caves
Well
They live in huts
Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated,  called  out  a wag from the crowd
Ford rounded on him angrily
Very funny, he said, but have you noticed that  they're  dying out
On their journey back,  Ford  and  Arthur  had  come  across  two derelict  villages  and  the bodies of many natives in the woods, where they had crept away to die
Those  that  still  lived  were
stricken  and listless, as if they were suffering some disease of the spirit rather than the body
They moved sluggishly  and  with
an infinite sadness
Their future had been taken away from them
Dying out
repeated Ford
Do you know what that means
Er
we shouldn't sell them any life  insurance
called  out the wag again
Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd
Can you try and understand, he  said,  that  it's  just  since we've arrived that they've started dying out
In fact that comes over terribly well in this  film,  said  the marketing  girl,  and just gives it that poignant twist which is the hallmark of the really great documentary
The producer's very
committed
He should be, muttered Ford
I gather, said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was beginning  to nod off, that he wants to make one about you next, Captain
Oh really
he said, coming to with  a  start,  that's  awfully nice
He's got a very strong angle on it,  you  know,  the  burden  of responsibility, the loneliness of command
The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment
Well, I wouldn't overstress  that  angle,  you  know,  he  said finally, one's never alone with a rubber duck
He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from  the crowd
All the while, the Management  Consultant  had  been  sitting  in stony silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary
At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all,  he would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn't happened
He rose to his feet
If, he said tersely, we could for a  moment  move  on  to  the subject of fiscal policy
Fiscal policy
whooped Ford Prefect, Fiscal policy
The Management Consultant gave him a look that  only  a  lungfish could have copied
Fiscal policy
he repeated, that is what I said
How can you have money, demanded Ford, if none of you actually produces anything
It doesn't grow on trees you know
If you would allow me to continue
Ford nodded dejectedly
Thank you
Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich
Ford  stared  in  disbelief  at  the  crowd  who  were  murmuring appreciatively  at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with which their track suits were stuffed
But we have also, continued  the  Management  Consultant,  run into  a  small  inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current  going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's peanut
Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd
The  Management  Consultant waved them down
So in  order  to  obviate  this  problem,  he  continued,  and effectively  revaluate  the  leaf,  we  are  about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and
er,  burn  down  all  the
forests
I  think  you'll all agree that's a sensible move under the circumstances
The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for  a  second  or two  until  someone  pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in  their  pockets  whereupon  they  let  out whoops  of  delight and gave the Management Consultant a standing ovation
The  accountants  amongst  them  looked  forward  to  a
profitable Autumn
You're all mad, explained Ford Prefect
You're absolutely barmy, he suggested
You're a bunch of raving nutters, he opined
The tide of opinion started to turn against him
What had started out  as  excellent  entertainment  had  now, in the crowd's view,
deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this  abuse  was  in  the main directed at them they wearied of it
Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him
Is it perhaps in order, she demanded, to inquire  what  you've been  doing  all these months then
You and that other interloper
have been missing since the day we arrived
We've been on a journey, said Ford, We went to  try  and  find out something about this planet
Oh, said the girl archly, doesn't  sound  very  productive  to me
No
Well have I got news for you, my love
We  have  discovered this planet's future
Ford waited for this statement to have its effect
It didn't have any
They didn't know what he was talking about
He continued
It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what  you  all choose  to  do  from  now on
Burn down the forests, anything, it
won't make a scrap of difference
Your future history has already happened
Two million years you've got and that's it
At the end
of that time your race will be dead, gone and  good  riddance  to you
Remember that, two million years
The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance
People as rich as they had  suddenly  become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort
of gibberish
Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away
They didn't need to bother
Ford was already stalking out of  the clearing,  pausing  only  to shake his head at Number Two who was
already firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees
He turned back once
Two million years
he said and laughed
Well, said the Captain with a soothing smile, still time for a few  more baths
Could someone pass me the sponge
I just dropped
it over the side
A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent  was  too  busily engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach
What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on a  wide  flat  piece  of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine  smaller squares, thirteen to a side
Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish stones  and  scratched  the shape of a letter on to each
Sitting
morosely round the rock were a  couple  of  the  surviving  local native  men  whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious concept embodied in these stones
So far they had not done well
They had attempted to eat some  of them,  bury  others  and  throw the rest of them away
Arthur had
finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones  on  the board  he  had  scratched  out, which was not even as far as he'd managed to get the day before
Along with the rapid deterioration
in   the  morale  of  these  creatures,  there  seemed  to  be  a corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence
In an attempt to egg them along,  Arthur  set  out  a  number  of letters  on  the  board  himself, and then tried to encourage the natives to add some more themselves
It was not going well
Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree
No, said Arthur to one of the natives  who  had  just  shuffled some  of  the  letters  round  in  a fit of abysmal dejection, Q scores ten you see, and it's on a triple word score, so
look,
I've  explained the rules to you
no no, look please, put down that  jawbone
alright,  we'll  start  again
And  try   to
concentrate this time
Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand  against  his head
What are you doing, Arthur
he asked quietly
Arthur looked up with a start
He suddenly had a feeling that all this  might  look  slightly  foolish
All he knew was that it had
worked like a dream on him when he was a chid
But  things  were different then, or rather would be
I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble, he said
They're not cavemen, said Ford
They look like cavemen
Ford let it pass
I see, he said
It's uphill work, said Arthur wearily, the only word they know is grunt and they can't spell it
He sighed and sat back
What's that supposed to achieve
asked Ford
We've got to encourage them to evolve
To develop
Arthur burst out  angrily
He  hoped  that  the weary sigh and then the anger
might do  something  to  counteract  the  overriding  feeling  of foolishness  from which he was currently suffering
It didn't
He
jumped to his feet
Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from  those
cretins we arrived with
he said
Imagine
said Ford, rising his  eyebrows
We  don't  have  to imagine
We've seen it
But
Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly
We've seen it, said Ford, there's no escape
Arthur kicked at a stone
Did you tell them what we've discovered
he asked
Hmmmm
said Ford, not really concentrating
Norway,  said  Arthur,  Slartibartfast's  signature   in   the glacier
Did you tell them
What's the point
said Ford, What would it mean to them
Mean
said Arthur, Mean
You  know  perfectly  well  what  it means
It means that this planet is the Earth
It's my home
It's
where I was born
Was
said Ford
Alright, will be
Yes, in two million years' time
Why don't you tell  them  that
Go  and  say to them, `Excuse me, I'd just like to point out that in two million years' time I will be born just a few  miles  from here
See  what  they  say
They'll chase you up a tree and set
fire to it
Arthur absorbed this unhappily
Face it, said Ford, those zeebs over there are your ancestors, not these poor creatures here
He went  over  to  where  the  apemen  creatures  were  rummaging listlessly with the stone letters
He shook his head
Put the Scrabble away, Arthur, he  said,  it  won't  save  the human  race,  because this lot aren't going to be the human race
The human race is currently sitting round a  rock  on  the  other side of this hill making documentaries about themselves
Arthur winced
There must be something we can do, he said
A terrible sense of desolation  thrilled  through his body that he should be here, on
the Earth, the Earth which had lost its future  in  a  horrifying arbitrary  catastrophe  and which now seemed set to lose its past as well
No, said Ford, there's nothing we can do
This doesn't  change the  history  of  the  Earth, you see, this is the history of the
Earth
Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you are  descended  from
in two million years they get destroyed by
the Vogons
History is  never  altered  you  see,  it  just  fits together like a jigsaw
Funny old thing, life, isn't it
He picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush where it hit a young rabbit
The rabbit hurtled off in terror and
didn't stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which  choked on  one  of  its  bones  and  died  on the bank of a stream which subsequently washed it away
During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his  pride  and struck  up  a  relationship  with a girl who had been a personnel officer on Golgafrincham, and he  was  terribly  upset  when  she suddenly  passed  away  as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox
The only  moral
it  is  possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable
Like most of the really crucial things in  life,  this  chain  of events  was completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent
They were looking sadly at one of the  natives  morosely  pushing the other letters around
Poor bloody caveman, said Arthur
They're not
What
Oh never mind
The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged on the rock
It's all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn't it
said Arthur
Uh uh urghhhhh, muttered the native  and  banged  on  the  rock again
They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers
Urgh, gr gr, gruh
insisted the native, continuing to  bang  on the rock
Why does he keep banging on the rock
said Arthur
I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again,  said Ford, he's pointing at the letters
Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor  bastard
I  keep  on telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc
The native banged on the rock again
They looked over his shoulder
Their eyes popped
There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid out in a clear straight line
They spelt two words
The words were these: Forty-Two
Grrrurgh guh guh, explained the native
He  swept  the  letters angrily  away  and  went and mooched under a nearby tree with his
colleague
Ford and Arthur stared at him
Then they stared at each other
Did that say what I thought it said
they  both  said  to  each other
Yes, they both said
Forty-two, said Arthur
Forty-two, said Ford
Arthur ran over to the two natives
What are you trying to tell us
he shouted
What's it supposed to mean
One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in  the air, rolled over again and went to sleep
The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts  at  Ford Prefect
Whatever  it was they had to say, they had already said
it
You know what this means, said Ford
Not entirely
Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the  Ultimate Answer
Yes
And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built  to calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer
So we are led to believe
And organic life was part of the computer matrix
If you say so
I do say so
That means that these natives, these apemen are  an integral  part  of  the  computer  program,  and  that we and the
Golgafrinchans are not
But the  cavemen  are  dying  out  and  the  Golgafrinchans  are obviously set to replace them
Exactly
So do you see what this means
What
Cock up, said Ford Prefect
Arthur looked around him
This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it, he said
Ford puzzled for a moment
Still, something must have come out of it,  he  said  at  last, because  Marvin  said  he could see the Question printed in your brain wave patterns
But
Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of  the  right  one
It might  give us a clue though if we could find it
I don't see how
we can though
They moped about for a bit
Arthur sat on the ground and  started pulling  up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation
he could get deeply  engrossed  in
It  wasn't  grass  he  could believe  in, the trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed
to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a  tunnel  to be crawled through
Ford fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic
It  was  silent
He sighed and put it away
Arthur picked up one of the  letter  stones  from  his  home-made Scrabble  set
It  was a T
He sighed and out it down again
The
letter he put down next to it was an I
That spelt IT
He  tossed another couple of letters next to them They were an S and an H as
it  happened
By  a  curious  coincidence  the  resulting   word perfectly  expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just
then
He  stared  at  it  for  a  moment
He  hadn't  done   it deliberately,  it  was just a random chance
His brain got slowly
into first gear
Ford, he said suddenly, look, if that Question is  printed  in my  brain  wave  patterns  but I'm not consciously aware of it it must be somewhere in my unconscious
Yes, I suppose so
There might be  a  way  of  bringing  that  unconscious  pattern forward
Oh yes
Yes, by introducing some random element that can  be  shaped  by that pattern
Like how
Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded
Ford leapt to his feet
Brilliant
he said
He tugged his towel out of his satchel  and with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag
Totally mad, he said, utter nonsense
But we'll do it  because it's brilliant nonsense
Come on, come on
The sun passed respectfully behind  a  cloud
A  few  small  sad raindrops fell
They piled together all the remaining letters  and  dropped  them into the bag
They shook them up
Right, said Ford, close your eyes
Pull them out
Come on come on, come on
Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful  of stones
He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to
Ford
Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them
W, said Ford, H, A, T
What
He blinked
I think it's working
he said
Arthur pushed three more at him
D, O, Y
Doy
Oh perhaps it isn't working, said Ford
Here's the next three
O, U, G
Doyoug
It's not making sense I'm afraid
Arthur pulled another two from the bag
Ford put them in place
E, T, doyouget
Do you get
shouted Ford,  it  is  working
This is amazing, it really is working
More here
Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as  fast  as he could go
I, F, said Ford, Y, O, U,
M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y,
What do  you  get if you multiply,
S, I, X,
six, B, Y, by, six
by
what do you get if you multiply six by
N, I, N, E,
six by nine
He paused
Come on, where's the next one
Er, that's the lot, said Arthur, that's all there were
He sat back, nonplussed
He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were  no more letters
You mean that's it
said Ford
That's it
Six by nine
Forty-two
That's it
That's all there is
The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them
A  bird  sang
A warm  breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the
flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods
An  insect droned  past  on  its way to do whatever it is that insects do in
the late afternoon
The sound of voices lilted through the  trees followed  a  moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at
the sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the ground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter
No, don't go, called Ford Prefect between gasps, we'll be with you in a moment
What's the matter
asked one of the girls
She was  the  taller and  slimmer  of  the two
On Golgafrincham she had been a junior
personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much
Ford pulled himself together
Excuse  me,  he  said,  hello
My  friend  and  I  were  just contemplating the meaning of life
Frivolous exercise
Oh it's you, said the girl, you made a bit of a  spectacle  of yourself  this  afternoon
You were quite funny to begin with but
you did bang on a bit
Did I
Oh yes
Yes, what was all that for
asked the  other  girl,  a  shorter round-faced  girl  who  had  been  an  art  director  for a small
advertising company on Golgafrincham
Whatever the privations  of this  world  were,  she  went  to  sleep  every  night profoundly
grateful for the fact that  whatever  she  had  to  face  in  the morning  it wouldn't be a hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste
For
For nothing
Nothing's for  anything,  said  Ford  Prefect happily
Come  and  join  us
Im Ford, this is Arthur
We were
just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait
The girls looked at them doubtfully
I'm Agda, said the tall one, this is Mella
Hello Agda, hello Mella, said Ford
Do you talk at all
said Mella to Arthur
Oh, eventually, said Arthur with a smile, but not as  much  as Ford
Good
There was a slight pause
What did you mean, asked Agda, about only having  two  million years
I couldn't make sense of what you were saying
Oh that, said Ford, it doesn't matter
It's just that the world gets  demolished  to  make  way  for  a hyperspace  bypass,  said  Arthur  with a shrug, but that's two million years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons do
Vogons
said Mella
Yes, you wouldn't know them
Where'd you get this idea from
It really doesn't matter
It's just like a dream from the  past, or the future
Arthur smiled and looked away
Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense
asked Agda
Listen, forget it,  said  Ford,  forget  all  of  it
Nothing matters
Look, it's a beautiful day, enjoy it
The sun, the green
of the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees
Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty  horrible  idea,  said Mella, destroying a world just to make a bypass
Oh, I've heard of worse, said Ford, I read of one  planet  off in  the  seventh  dimension  that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic bar billiards
Got potted  straight  into  a  black
hole
Killed ten billion people
That's mad, said Mella
Yes, only scored thirty points too
Agda and Mella exchanged glances
Look, said Agda, there's a party after the  committee  meeting tonight
You can come along if you like
Yeah, OK, said Ford
I'd like to, said Arthur
Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the  moon  rise over the dull red glow of the trees
That story about the world being destroyed
began Mella
In two million years, yes
You say it as if you really think it's true
Yes, I think it is
I think I was there
She shook her head in puzzlement
You're very strange, she said
No, I'm very ordinary, said  Arthur,  but  some  very  strange things  have happened to me
You could say I'm more differed from
than differing
And that other world your friend talked about, the one that  got pushed into a black hole
Ah, that I don't know about
It sounds like something  from  the book
What book
Arthur paused
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, he said at last
What's that
Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening
I  don't think I'll be wanting it any more, said Arthur Dent
The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of  Arthur Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was
It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was damp  and smelly
It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington and there wasn't a bus due for two million years
Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in,  as  Arthur Dent  could  testify,  having  been lost in both time and space a good deal
At least being lost in space kept you busy
He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of  a  complex sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of  the  Galaxy  than  he ever  dreamt  existed,  and  though his life had now turned very, very, very quiet, he was still feeling jumpy
He hadn't been blown up now for five years
Since he had hardly seen anyone since he  and  Ford  Prefect  had parted  company four years previously, he hadn't been insulted in all that time either
Except just once
It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously
He was returning to his cave just a little  after  dusk  when  he became  aware  of  lights  flashing eerily through the clouds
He turned and stared, with  hope  suddenly  clambering  through  his heart
Rescue
Escape
The castaway's impossible dream - a ship
And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a  long silver  ship  descended  through  the  warm evening air, quietly, without fuss, its long legs  unlocking  in  a  smooth  ballet  of technology
It alighted gently on the ground, and  what  little  hum  it  had generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm
A ramp extended itself
Light streamed out
A tall figure appeared silhouetted in  the  hatchway
It  walked down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur
You're a jerk, Dent, it said simply
It was alien, very alien
It had a  peculiar  alien  tallness,  a peculiar alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes,
extravagantly draped golden ropes with a peculiarly alien  collar design,  and  pale  grey-green alien skin which had about it that lustrous shine which most grey-green faces can only acquire  with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap
Arthur boggled at it
It gazed levelly at him
Arthur's first sensations of hope and trepidation  had  instantly been  overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use of his vocal chords at this moment
Whh
he said
Bu
hu
uh
he added
Ru
ra
wah
who
he managed finally to say and lapsed into  a  frantic  kind  of silence
He was feeling the effects of
having not said anything to anybody  for  as  long  as  he  could remember
The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand
Arthur Dent
it said
Arthur nodded helplessly
Arthur Philip Dent
pursued the alien in a  kind  of  efficient yap
Er
er
yes
er
er, confirmed Arthur
You're a jerk, repeated the alien, a complete asshole
Er
The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on  its clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship
Er
said Arthur desperately, er
Don't give me that
snapped the alien
It marched up the  ramp,
through  the  hatchway  and  disappeared  into the ship
The ship sealed itself
It started to make a low throbbing hum
Er, hey
shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly  towards it
Wait a minute
he called
What is this
What
Wait a minute
The ship rose, as if shedding its weight  like  a  cloak  to  the
ground,  and  hovered  briefly
It  swept  strangely up into the evening sky
It passed up through the clouds,  illuminating  them
briefly,  and then was gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing a helplessly tiny little dance
What
he screamed
What
What
Hey, what
Come back  here  and say that
He jumped and danced until his legs trembled,  and  shouted  till his  lungs  rasped
There was no answer from anyone
There was no
one to hear him or speak to him
The alien ship was already thundering towards the  upper  reaches of  the  atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each other
Its occupant, the alien with  the  expensive  complexion,  leaned back  in  its  single seat
His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely
Prolonged
He was a man with a purpose
Not a very good  purpose, as  he  would have been the first to admit, but it was at least a
purpose and it did at least keep him on the move
Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was --indeed, is - one of  the Universe's very small number of immortal beings
Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to  cope  with it, but Wowbagger was not one of them
Indeed he had come to hate
them, the load of serene bastards
He  had  had  his  immortality thrust  upon  him  by  an unfortunate accident with an irrational
particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber  bands
The  precise details of the accident are not important because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact  circumstances  under which  it  happened,  and  many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, or both, trying
Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim  and  weary  expression,  put some light jazz on the ship's stereo, and reflected that he could have made it if it hadn't been for Sunday afternoons,  he  really could have done
To begin with it was fun, he  had  a  ball,  living  dangerously, taking  risks,  cleaning  up on high-yield long-term investments, and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody
In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't  cope  with, and  that  terrible  listlessness which starts to set in at about 2
55, when you know  that  you've  had  all  the  baths  you  can
usefully  have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it,  or  use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will  move  relentlessly  on  to four  o'clock,  and  you  will enter the long dark teatime of the soul
So things began to pall for him
The merry smiles he used to wear at other people's funerals began to fade
He began to despise the
Universe in general, and everyone in it in particular
This was the point at which he conceived his purpose,  the  thing which  would  drive  him  on,  and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on forever
It was this
He would insult the Universe
That  is,  he  would  insult  everybody  in   it
Individually, personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided
to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order
When people protested to him, as they sometimes  had  done,  that the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying  all  the  time,  he would  merely  fix  them  with  a steely look and say, A man can dream can't he
And so he started out
He equipped a spaceship that was built  to last   with  the  computer  capable  of  handling  all  the  data
processing involved in keeping track of the entire population  of the  known  Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved
His ship fled through the inner orbits of the  Sol  star  system, preparing  to  slingshot  round the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space
Computer, he said
Here, yipped the computer
Where next
Computing that
Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic  jewellery  of  the night,  the  billions  of  tiny  diamond  worlds  that dusted the infinite darkness with light
Every one, every single one, was on
his  itinerary
Most  of  them  he would be going to millions of times over
He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in  the  sky  like  a child's numbered dots puzzle
He hoped that
from some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell a very, very rude word
The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it  had  finished its calculations
Folfanga, it said
It beeped
Fourth world of the Folfanga system, it  continued
It  beeped again
Estimated journey time, three weeks, it continued  further
It beeped again
There to meet with a small slug, it beeped, of  the  genus  A- Rth-Urp-Hil-Ipdenu
I believe, it added, after  a  slight  pause  during  which  it beeped, that you had decided to call it a brainless prat
Wowbagger grunted
He watched the majesty of creation outside his window for a moment or two
I think I'll take a nap, he said, and then added, what network areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours
The computer beeped
Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box, it said, and beeped
Any movies I haven't seen thirty thousand times already
No
Uh
There's Angst in  Space
You've  only  seen  that  thirty-three
thousand five hundred and seventeen times
Wake me for the second reel
The computer beeped
Sleep well, it said
The ship fled on through the night
Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and  Arthur  Dent sat  in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life, thinking of things he could  have  said  to  the alien and swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening
The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit  skin  because he thought it would be useful to keep things in
This morning, two years later than that, was sweet  and  fragrant as  he  emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a better name for it or find a better cave
Though his throat was sore again from his early morning  yell  of horror,  he  was suddenly in a terrifically good mood
He wrapped
his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him  and  beamed  at the bright morning
The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the butterflies were  flitting  about  prettily,  and  the whole  of  nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could
It wasn't all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur  feel so  cheery, though
He had just had a wonderful idea about how to
cope with the terrible  lonely  isolation,  the  nightmares,  the failure  of  all  his  attempts  at  horticulture,  and the sheer futurelessness and futility  of  his  life  here  on  prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad
He beamed again and took a bite out of a  rabbit  leg  left  over from  his  supper
He  chewed happily for a few moments and then
decided formally to announce his decision
He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the  fields and hills
To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in
his hair
He spread his arms out wide
I will go mad
he announced
Good idea, said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock  on which he had been sitting
Arthur's brain somersaulted
His jaw did press-ups
I went mad for a while, said Ford, did me no end of good
You see, said Ford, -
Where have you been
interrupted Arthur, now that his head  had finished working out
Around, said Ford, around and about
He grinned  in  what  he accurately  judged  to  be an infuriating manner
I just took my
mind off the hook for a bit
I reckoned that if the world  wanted me badly enough it would call back
It did
He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic
At least, he said, I think it did
This has been playing up  a bit
He  shook it
If it was a false alarm I shall go mad, he
said, again
Arthur shook his head and sat down
He looked up
I thought you must be dead
he said simply
So did I for a while, said Ford, and then I decided  I  was  a lemon  for  a couple of weeks
A kept myself amused all that time
jumping in and out of a gin and tonic
Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again
Where, he said, did you
Find a gin and tonic
said Ford brightly
I found a small lake
that  thought  it  was  a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that
At least, I think it thought it was a gin and tonic
I may, he added with a grin which  would  have  sent  sane  men scampering into trees, have been imagining it
He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than that
Carry on, he said levelly
The point is, you see, said Ford, that there is  no  point  in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad
You might
just as well give in and save your sanity for later
And this is you sane again, is it
said Arthur
I  ask  merely
for information
I went to Africa, said Ford
Yes
Yes
What was that like
And this is your cave is it
said Ford
Er, yes, said Arthur
He felt very strange
After  nearly  four years  of  total  isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see
Ford that he could almost cry
Ford was, on the  other  hand,  an almost immediately annoying person
Very nice, said Ford, in reference to Arthur's cave
You  must hate it
Arthur didn't bother to reply
Africa was very interesting, said Ford, I behaved  very  oddly there
He gazed thoughtfully into the distance
I took up being cruel to animals, he said airily
But  only, he added, as a hobby
Oh yes, said Arthur, warily
Yes, Ford assured him
I won't disturb you  with  the  details because they would -
What
Disturb you
But you  may  be  interested  to  know  that  I  am
singlehandedly  responsible  for  the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe
And I tried  to
learn to fly
Do you believe me
Tell me, said Arthur
I'll tell you later
I'll just mention that the Guide says
The
Guide
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
You remember
Yes
I remember throwing it in the river
Yes, said Ford, but I fished it out
You didn't tell me
I didn't want you to throw it in again
Fair enough, admitted Arthur
It says
What
The Guide says
The Guide says there is an art to flying, said Ford, or rather a  knack
The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the
ground and miss
He smiled weakly
He pointed at  the  knees  of his  trousers  and held his arms up to show the elbows
They were
all torn and worn through
I haven't done very well so far, he  said
He  stuck  out  his hand
I'm very glad to see you again, Arthur, he added
Arthur  shook  his  head  in  a  sudden  access  of  emotion  and bewilderment
I haven't seen anyone for years, he said, not  anyone
I  can hardly  even  remember  how  to speak
I keep forgetting words
I
practise you see
I practise by talking to
talking  to
what  are  those  things  people think you're mad if you talk to
Like George the Third
Kings
suggested Ford
No, no, said Arthur
The things he  used  to  talk  to
We're surrounded  by  them  for  heaven's  sake
I've planted hundreds
myself
They all died
Trees
I practise  by  talking  to  trees
What's that for
Ford still had his hand stuck  out
Arthur  looked  at  it  with
incomprehension
Shake, prompted Ford
Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to  be  a fish
Then  he  grasped  it  vigorously  with  both  hands in an
overwhelming flood of relief
He shook it and shook it
After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage
They  climbed to  the  top  of  a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene
around them
What happened to the Golgafrinchans
asked Ford
Arthur shrugged
A lot of them didn't make it  through  the  winter  three  years ago,  he said, and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a holiday and set off on a raft
History  says  that  they
must have survived
Huh, said Ford, well well
He stuck his hands on his hips and
looked  round again at the empty world
Suddenly, there was about Ford a sense of energy and purpose
We're going, he said excitedly, and shivered with energy
Where
How
said Arthur
I don't know, said Ford, but I just  feel  that  the  time  is right
Things are going to happen
We're on our way
He lowered his voice to a whisper
I have detected, he said, disturbances in the wash
He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite
like  the  wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy fooling around with some  leaves  a  little way off
Arthur asked him to repeat what  he  had  just  said  because  he hadn't quite taken his meaning
Ford repeated it
The wash
said Arthur
The space-time wash, said Ford, and as the  wind  blew  briefly past at that moment, he bared his teeth into it
Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat
Are we talking about, he asked cautiously, some sort of  Vogon laundromat, or what are we talking about
Eddies, said Ford, in the space-time continuum
Ah, nodded Arthur, is he
Is he
He pushed his hands into the
pocket  of  his  dressing  gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance
What
said Ford
Er, who, said Arthur, is Eddy, then, exactly
Ford looked angrily at him
Will you listen
he snapped
I have been listening, said Arthur,  but  I'm  not  sure  it's helped
Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke  to him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody from a telephone company accounts department
There seem
he said, to be some pools
he  said,  of instability
he said, in the fabric
he said
Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing  gown  where Ford  was  holding it
Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the
foolish look into a foolish remark
in the fabric of space-time, he said
Ah, that, said Arthur
Yes, that, confirmed Ford
They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric Earth and  stared each other resolutely in the face
And it's done what
said Arthur
It, said Ford, has developed pools of instability
Has it
said Arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment
It has, said Ford with a similar degree of ocular immobility
Good, said Arthur
See
said Ford
No, said Arthur
There was a quiet pause
The difficulty with this conversation, said Arthur after a sort of  pondering  look  had  crawled  slowly  across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky  outcrop,  is  that  it's  very different  from  most  of  the ones I've had of late
Which, as I
explained, have mostly been with trees
They weren't  like  this
Except  perhaps  some  of  the  ones  I've  had  with  elms which sometimes get a bit bogged down
Arthur, said Ford
Hello
Yes
said Arthur
Just believe everything I tell you, and it  will  all  be  very, very simple
Ah, well I'm not sure I believe that
They sat down and composed their thoughts
Ford got out his  Sub-Etha  Sens-O-Matic
It  was  making  vague humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly
Flat battery
said Arthur
No, said Ford, there is a moving disturbance in the fabric  of space-time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it's somewhere in our vicinity
Where
Ford moved the device in  a  slow  lightly  bobbing  semi-circle
Suddenly the light flashed
There
said Ford, shooting out his  arm
There,  behind  that sofa
Arthur looked
Much to his surprise, there was a velvet  paisley- covered  Chesterfield  sofa  in  the  field  in front of them
He
boggled intelligently at it
Shrewd  questions  sprang  into  his mind
Why, he said, is there a sofa in that field
I told you
shouted Ford, leaping to his feet
Eddies  in  the
space-time continuum
And this is his sofa, is it
asked Arthur,  struggling  to  his
feet  and,  he  hoped,  though  not  very  optimistically, to his senses
Arthur
shouted Ford at him, that sofa is there because of the space-time  instability  I've  been trying to get your terminally
softened brain to get to grips with
It's been washed out of  the continuum,  it's space-time jetsam, it doesn't matter what it is,
we've got to catch it, it's our only way out of here
He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made  off  across
the field
Catch it
muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that  the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across
the grass
With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and  plunged  off  in  hectic  pursuit  of  Ford  Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture
They  careered  wildly  through  the  grass,  leaping,  laughing, shouting  instructions  to  each other to head the thing off this way or that way
The sun shone dreamily  on  the  swaying  grass,
tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake
Arthur felt happy
He was terribly pleased that the day  was  for once  working  out so much according to plan
Only twenty minutes
ago he had decided he would  go  mad,  and  now  he  was  already chasing  a  Chesterfield  sofa  across  the fields of prehistoric Earth
The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others
Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it  dodged  and weaved  as  if following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was
Still they pursued, still it danced and  span,  and
suddenly   turned  and  dipped  as  if  crossing  the  lip  of  a catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it
With a
heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in  the middle  of  the  pitch  at Lord's Cricked Ground, St John's Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test Match of the  Australian Series  in  the year 198-, with England needing only twenty-eight runs to win

It was a charming and delightful day at Lord's as Ford and Arthur tumbled  haphazardly  out  of  a  space-time  anomaly and hit the immaculate turf rather hard
The applause of the crowd was tremendous
It wasn't for them, but instinctively  they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the
small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding whistled  mere millimetres over Arthur's head
In the crowd a man
collapsed
They threw themselves back to the ground  which  seemed  to  spin hideously around them
What was that
hissed Arthur
Something red, hissed Ford back at him
Where are we
Er, somewhere green
Shapes, muttered Arthur
I need shapes
The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps  of
astonishment,  and  the awkward titters of hundreds of people who could not yet make up their minds about whether to  believe  what they had just seen or not
This your sofa
said a voice
What was that
whispered Ford
Arthur looked up
Something blue, he said
Shape
said Ford
Arthur looked again
It is shaped,  he  hissed  at  Ford,  with  his  brow  savagely furrowing, like a policeman
They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning  deeply
The  blue  thing  shaped like a policeman tapped them both on the shoulders
Come on, you two, the shape said, let's be having you
These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur
He leapt to his
feet  like  an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled glanced at the panorama around him  which  had  suddenly settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness
Where did you get this from
he yelled at the policeman shape
What did you say
said the startled shape
This is Lord's Cricket Ground, isn't it
snapped Arthur
Where did  you  find  it,  how did you get it here
I think, he added,
clasping his hand to his brow, that I had better calm down
He squatted down abruptly in front of Ford
It is a policeman, he said, What do we do
Ford shrugged
What do you want to do
he said
I want you, said Arthur, to tell me that I have been  dreaming for the last five years
Ford shrugged again, and obliged
You've been dreaming for the last five years, he said
Arthur got to his feet
It's all right, officer, he said
I've been dreaming  for  the last five years
Ask him, he added, pointing at Ford, he was in
it
Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch,
brushing  down  his  dressing  gown
He then noticed his dressing gown and stopped
He stared  at  it
He  flung  himself  at  the
policeman
So where did I get these clothes from
he howled
He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass
Ford shook his head
He's had a bad two million years, he said to the policeman, and together  they  heaved  Arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the  pitch  and  were  only  briefly  hampered  by   the   sudden disappearance of the sofa on the way
Reaction to all this from the crowd were many and  various
Most of them couldn't cope with watching it, and listened to it on the
radio instead
Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian,  said  one  radio commentator  to  another
I  don't  think  there  have been any
mysterious materializations on the pitch since, oh since, well  I don't think there have been any - have there
that I recall
Edgbaston, 1932
Ah, now what happened then
Well, Peter, I think it was Canter facing Willcox coming  up  to bowl from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight across the pitch
There was a pause while the first commentator considered this
Ye
e
s
he said, yes, there's nothing actually very mysterious  about that, is there
He didn't actually materialize,
did he
Just ran on
No, that's true,  but  he  did  claim  to  have  seen  something
materialize on the pitch
Ah, did he
Yes
An alligator, I think, of some description
Ah
And had anyone else noticed it
Apparently not
And no one was  able  to  get  a  very  detailed description  from  him,  so  only the most perfunctory search was
made
And what happened to the man
Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him  some lunch,  but he explained that he'd already had a rather good one, so the matter was dropped and Warwickshire  went  on  to  win  by three wickets
So, not very like this current instance
For those of you who've just  tuned  in,  you  may be interested to know that, er
two
men, two rather scruffily attired men, and  indeed  a  sofa  -  a Chesterfield I think
Yes, a Chesterfield
Have just materialized here in  the  middle  of  Lord's  Cricket
Ground
But I don't think they meant any harm, they've been very good-natured about it, and
Sorry, can I interrupt you a moment Peter and say that the  sofa has just vanished
So it has
Well, that's one mystery less
Still, it's definitely one  for the record books I think, particularly occurring at this
dramatic moment in play, England  now  needing  only  twenty-four runs  to  win  the  series
The men are leaving the pitch in the
company of a police officer, and I think everyone's settling down now and play is about to resume
Now, sir, said the policeman after  they  had  made  a  passage through the curious crowd and laid Arthur's peacefully inert body on a blanket, perhaps you'd care to tell me who you  are,  where you come from, and what that little scene was all about
Ford looked at the ground for a moment as  if  steadying  himself for  something,  then  he straightened up and aimed a look at the policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of  the six  hundred  light-years' distance between Earth and Ford's home near Betelgeuse
All right, said Ford, very quietly, I'll tell you
Yes,  well,  that  won't  be  necessary,  said  the   policeman
hurriedly,  just  don't  let whatever  it was happen again
The policeman turned around and wandered off in search of anyone  who
wasn't from Betelgeuse
Fortunately, the ground was full of them
Arthur's consciousness  approached  his  body  as  from  a  great distance,  and  reluctantly
It had had some bad times in there
Slowly,  nervously,  it  entered  and  settled  down  in  to  its accustomed position
Arthur sat up
Where am I
he said
Lord's Cricket Ground, said Ford
Fine, said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again  for a quick breather
His body flopped back on the grass
Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in  the  refreshment tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face
How're you feeling
said Ford
I'm home, said Arthur hoarsely
He closed his eyes and greedily inhaled  the  steam  from  his tea as if it was - well, as far as
Arthur was concerned, as if it was tea, which it was
I'm home, he repeated, home
It's  England,  it's  today,  the nightmare is over
He opened his eyes again and smiled serenely
I'm where I belong, he said in an emotional whisper
There are two things I fell which I should tell you, said Ford, tossing a copy of the Guardian over the table at him
I'm home, said Arthur
Yes, said Ford
One is, he said pointing at the date  at  the top of the paper, that the Earth will be demolished in two days'
time
I'm home, said Arthur
Tea, he said, cricket, he added with
pleasure,  mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer cans
Slowly he began to focus on the newspaper
He cocked his head  on one side with a slight frown
I've seen that one before, he said
His eyes wandered slowly up to the date, which Ford was idly tapping at
His face froze for a
second or two and then began to do that  terribly  slow  crashing trick which Arctic ice-floes do so spectacularly in the spring
And the other thing, said Ford, is that you appear to  have  a bone in your beard
He tossed back his tea
Outside the refreshment tent, the sun  was  shining  on  a  happy crowd
It  shone  on  white  hats and red faces
It shone on ice
lollies and melted them
It shone on the tears of small  children whose  ice  lollies  had just melted and fallen off the stick
It
shone on the trees, it flashed  off  whirling  cricket  bats,  it gleamed  off  the  utterly  extraordinary object which was parked behind the  sight-screens  and  which  nobody  appeared  to  have noticed
It  beamed  on Ford and Arthur as they emerged blinking
from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene around them
Arthur was shaking
Perhaps, he said, I should
No, said Ford sharply
What
said Arthur
Don't try and phone yourself up at home
How did you know
Ford shrugged
But why not
said Arthur
People who talk to themselves on the phone, said  Ford,  never learn anything to their advantage
But
Look, said Ford
He picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an
imaginary dial
Hello
he said into the imaginary mouthpiece
Is  that  Arthur Dent
Ah,  hello,  yes
This is Arthur Dent speaking
Don't hang
up
He looked at the imaginary mouthpiece in disappointment
He hung up, he said, shrugged,  and  put  the  imaginary  phone neatly back on its imaginary hook
This is not my first temporal anomaly, he added
A glummer look replaced the already glum look  on  Arthur  Dent's face
So we're not home and dry, he said
We could not even be  said,  replied  Ford,  to  be  home  and vigorously towelling ourselves off
The game continued
The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, a trot,  and  then  a run
He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms
and legs, out of  which  flew  a  ball
The  batsman  swung  and thwacked  it  behind  him  over  the  sight-screens
Ford's eyes
followed the trajectory of the ball and  jogged  momentarily
He stiffened
He looked along the flight path of the ball again and
his eyes twitched again
This isn't my towel, said Arthur,  who  was  rummaging  in  his rabbit-skin bag
Shhh, said Ford
He screwed his eyes up in concentration
I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel, continued Arthur, it  was blue with yellow stars on it
This isn't it
Shhh, said Ford again
He covered one eye and looked  with  the other
This one's pink, said Arthur, it isn't yours is it
I would like you to shut up about your towel, said Ford
It isn't my towel, insisted Arthur, that is  the  point  I  am trying to
And the time at which I would like you to  shut  up  about  it, continued Ford in a low growl, is now
All right, said Arthur, starting to  stuff  it  back  into  the primitively  stitched  rabbit-skin  bag
I  realize  that it is
probably not important in the cosmic scale of things,  it's  just odd,  that's  all
A  pink towel suddenly, instead of a blue one
with yellow stars
Ford was beginning to behave  rather  strangely,  or  rather  not
actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a way which was strangely different from the other  strange  ways in  which  he more regularly behaved
What he was doing was this
Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow members  of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his hands in sharp movements across his  face,  ducking  down  behind some  people,  leaping  up behind others, then standing still and blinking a lot
After a moment or two of this he started to stalk
forward   slowly  and  stealthily  wearing  a  puzzled  frown  of concentration, like a leopard that's not sure whether  it's  just seen  a  half-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty plain
This isn't my bag either, said Arthur suddenly
Ford's spell of concentration was broken
He  turned  angrily  on Arthur
I  wasn't  talking  about  my  towel,   said   Arthur
We've established  that  that  isn't  mine
It's just that the bag into
which I was putting the towel which is not mine is also not mine, though it is extraordinarily similar
Now personally I think that
that is extremely odd, especially as  the  bag  was  one  I  made myself  on  prehistoric  Earth
These are also not my stones, he
added, pulling a few flat grey stones out  of  the  bag
I  was making  a  collection of interesting stones and these are clearly
very dull ones
A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd  and  obliterated
whatever  it  was  that  Ford  said  in  reply  to  this piece of information
The cricket ball which  had  excited  this  reaction
fell  out  of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur's mysterious rabbit-skin bag
Now I would say that that was also a very curious  event,  said Arthur,  rapidly  closing  the bag and pretending to look for the ball on the ground
I don't think  it's  here,  he  said  to  the  small  boys  who immediately  clustered  round  him  to  join  in  the search, it probably rolled off somewhere
Over there I expect
He  pointed
vaguely  in the direction in which he wished they would push off
One of the boys looked at him quizzically
You all right
said the boy
No, said Arthur
Then why you got a bone in your beard
said the boy
I'm training it to like being wherever it's put
Arthur  prided himself  on  saying this
It was, he thought, exactly the sort of
thing which would entertain and stimulate young minds
Oh, said the small boy,  putting  his  head  to  one  side  and thinking about it
What's your name
Dent, said Arthur, Arthur Dent
You're a jerk, Dent, said the boy, a  complete  asshole
The
boy  looked past him at something else, to show that he wasn't in any  particular  hurry  to  run  away,  and  then  wandered   off scratching  his  nose
Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth
was going to be demolished again in two days' time, and just this once didn't feel too bad about it
Play resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking
Something's on your mind, isn't it
said Arthur
I think, said Ford in a tone  of  voice  which  Arthur  by  now recognized    as    one    which   presaged   something   utterly unintelligible, that there's an SEP over there
He pointed
Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not the  one  in  which  he  was  looking
Arthur  looked in the one
direction, which was towards the sight-screens, and in the  other which  was  at  the  field  of  play
He nodded, he shrugged
He
shrugged again
A what
he said
An SEP
An S
EP
And what's that
Somebody Else's Problem
Ah, good, said Arthur and relaxed
He had no idea what all that
was about, but at least it seemed to be over
It wasn't
Over there, said Ford, again pointing at the sight-screens  and looking at the pitch
Where
said Arthur
There
said Ford
I see, said Arthur, who didn't
You do
said Ford
What
said Arthur
Can you see, said Ford patiently, the SEP
I thought you said that was somebody else's problem
That's right
Arthur nodded slowly,  carefully  and  with  an  air  of  immense
stupidity
And I want to know, said Ford, if you can see it
You do
Yes
What, said Arthur, does it look like
Well, how should I know, you fool
shouted Ford
If  you  can see it, you tell me
Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind  the temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with Ford
His brain lurked like a frightened  puppy  in  its  kennel
Ford took him by the arm
An SEP, he said, is something that we can't see, or don't see, or  our  brain  doesn't  let  us  see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem
That's what SEP means
Somebody  Else's
Problem
The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot
If you look at  it  directly  you  won't  see  it  unless  you  know
precisely  what  it is
Your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye
Ah, said Arthur, then that's why
Yes, said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say
you've been jumping up and
Yes
down, and blinking
Yes
and
I think you've got the message
I can see it, said Arthur, it's a spaceship
For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction  this  revelation
provoked
A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction people were running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each  other
in  a  tumult  of confusion
He stumbled back in astonishment and glanced fearfully around
Then he glanced around  again  in  even
greater astonishment
Exciting, isn't it
said an apparition
The apparition  wobbled in  front  of  Arthur's  eyes,  though the truth of the matter is
probably that  Arthur's  eyes  were  wobbling  in  front  of  the apparition
His mouth wobbled as well
W
w
w
w
his mouth said
I think your team have just won, said the apparition
W
w
w
w
repeated Arthur,  and  punctuated  each wobble  with  a  prod at Ford Prefect's back
Ford was staring at
the tumult in trepidation
You are English, aren't you
said the apparition
W
w
w
w
yes said Arthur
Well, your team, as I say, have just won
The  match
It  means they  retain the Ashes
You must be very pleased
I must say, I'm
rather fond of cricket, though I  wouldn't  like  anyone  outside this planet to hear me saying that
Oh dear no
The apparition gave what looked  as  if  it  might  have  been  a mischievous  grin,  but  it  was hard to tell because the sun was directly behind him, creating a blinding halo round his head  and illuminating  his  silver  hair  and  beard  in  a  way which was awesome, dramatic and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins
Still, he said, it'll all be over in a couple of  days,  won't it
Though  as  I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry
about that
Still, whatever will have been, will have been
Arthur tried to speak, but  gave  up  the  unequal  struggle
He
prodded Ford again
I thought something terrible had happened, said Ford, but it's just  the  end  of  the  game
We  ought  to get out
Oh, hello,
Slartibartfast, what are you doing here
Oh, pottering, pottering, said the old man gravely
That your ship
Can you give us a lift anywhere
Patience, patience, the old man admonished
OK, said Ford
It's  just  that  this  planet's  going  to  be demolished pretty soon
I know that, said Slartibartfast
And, well, I just wanted to make that point, said Ford
The point is taken
And if you feel that you really want to  hang  around  a  cricket
pitch at this point
I do
Then it's your ship
It is
I suppose
Ford turned away sharply at this point
Hello, Slartibartfast, said Arthur at last
Hello, Earthman, said Slartibartfast
After all, said Ford, we can only die once
The old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch,  with
eyes  that  seemed  alive  with  expressions that had no apparent bearing on what was happening out there
What was  happening  was
that  the crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the centre of the pitch
What Slartibartfast  saw  in  it,  he  alone
knew
Ford was humming something
It was  just  one  note  repeated  at intervals
He was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was
humming, but nobody did
If anybody had asked him he  would  have said  he  was humming the first line of a Noel Coward song called
Mad About the Boy over and over again
It would then have  been pointed out to him that he was only singing one note, to which he
would have replied that for  reasons  which  he  hoped  would  be apparent, he was omitting the about the boy bit
He was annoyed
that nobody asked
It's just, he burst out at last, that if we don't go soon,  we might  get  caught  in  the  middle  of it all again
And there's
nothing that  depresses  me  more  than  seeing  a  planet  being destroyed
Except  possibly  still  being on it when it happens
Or, he added in an undertone, hanging around cricket matches
Patience, said Slartibartfast again
Great things are afoot
That's what you said last time we met, said Arthur
They were, said Slartibartfast
Yes, that's true, admitted Arthur
All, however, that seemed to be afoot  was  a  ceremony  of  some kind
It was being specially staged for the benefit of tv rather
than the spectators, and all they  could  gather  about  it  from where they were standing was what they heard from a nearby radio
Ford was aggressively uninterested
He fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about  to be  presented to the Captain of the English team out there on the pitch, fumed when told that this was because  they  had  now  won them  for  the  nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the information that the Ashes were the remains of a  cricket  stump, and  when, further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket stump in question had been burnt  in  Melbourne, Australia, in 1882, to signify the death of English cricket, he rounded on Slartibartfast, took a deep breath, but didn't have  a chance  to  say anything because the old man wasn't there
He was
marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in  his  gait, his  hair, beard and robes swept behind him, looking very much as Moses would have looked if Sinai had been a well-cut lawn instead of, as it is more usually represented, a fiery smoking mountain
He said to meet him at his ship, said Arthur
What in the name of zarking fardwarks is the  old  fool  doing
exploded Ford
Meeting us at his ship in two minutes, said Arthur with a shrug which  indicated  total  abdication  of thought
They started off
towards it
Strange sounds reached their ears
They tried not  to listen,  but  could  not  help  noticing  that Slartibartfast was
querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn  containing the  Ashes,  as  they  were,  he said, vitally important for the past, present and future safety of the Galaxy, and that this was causing wild hilarity
They resolved to ignore it
What happened next they could not ignore
With  a  noise  like  a hundred  thousand  people  saying wop, a steely white spaceship
suddenly seemed to create  itself  out  of  nothing  in  the  air directly  above  the  cricket  pitch and hung there with infinite menace and a slight hum
Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected  everybody  to go  about  their  normal  business  and  not mind it just hanging there
Then it did something quite extraordinary
Or rather,  it  opened up  and  let something quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven
quite extraordinary things
They were robots, white robots
What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared  to have come dressed for the occasion
Not only were they white, but
they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but  they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not only that but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower  parts of  their  legs
These  last  were  extraordinary  because  they
appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously  civilized robots  to  fly  down  from their hovering spaceship and start to kill people, which is what they did Hello, said Arthur, something seems to be happening
Get to the ship, shouted Ford
I don't want to know,  I  don't want to see, I don't want to hear, he yelled as he ran, this is
not my planet, I didn't choose to be here, I don't  want  to  get involved,  just  get  me out of here, and get me to a party, with people I can relate to
Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch
Well, the supernatural brigade certainly  seems  to  be  out  in force here today
burbled a radio happily to itself
What I need, shouted Ford, by way of  clarifying  his  previous remarks,  is  a  strong drink and a peer-group
He continued to
run, pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur's arm and drag  him along  with him
Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which
was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him
They're playing cricket, muttered Arthur, stumbling along after Ford
I  swear they are playing cricket
I do not know why they
are doing this, but that is what they are doing
They're not just killing  people,  they're  sending  them  up, he shouted, Ford,
they're sending us up
It would have been hard to  disbelieve  this  without  knowing  a
great  deal  more Galactic history than Arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels
The ghostly but  violent  shapes  that
could  be seen moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting  strokes,  the difference  being  that  every  ball  they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed
The very  first  one  of  these  had
dispelled  Arthur's  initial reaction, that the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by Australian margarine manufacturers
And then, as suddenly as it had all started,  it  was  over
The eleven  white  robots  ascended  through  the seething cloud in a
tight formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels  of  their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a hundred thousand people saying foop, promptly vanished into the thin air out of which it had wopped
For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and  then  out of  the  drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast looking even more like Moses because in spite  of  the  continued absence  of  the  mountain  he was at least now striding across a fiery and smoking well-mown lawn
He stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying  figures  of Arthur  Dent  and  Ford  Prefect  forcing  their  way through the frightened crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in  the opposite  direction
The  crowd  was  clearly thinking to itself
about what an unusual day this was turning out  to  be,  and  not really knowing which way, if any, to turn
Slartibartfast was gesturing urgently  at  Ford  and  Arthur  and shouting at them, as the three of them gradually converged on his ship, still parked behind the sight-screens and still  apparently unnoticed  by  the  crowd  stampeding  past it who presumably had enough of their own problems to cope with at that time
They've garble warble farble
shouted  Slartibartfast  in  his thin tremulous voice
What did he say
panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards
Arthur shook his head
They've
something or other, he said
They've table warble farble
shouted Slartibartfast again
Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other
It sounds urgent, said Arthur
He stopped and shouted
What
They've  garble  warble  fashes
cried  Slartibartfast,  still
waving at them
He says, said Arthur, that they've taken the  Ashes
That  is what I think he says
They ran on
The
said Ford
Ashes, said Arthur tersely
The burnt  remains  of  a  cricket stump
It's  a  trophy
That
he  was  panting,  is
apparently
what they
have come and taken
He  shook  his head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle
down lower in his skull
Strange thing to want to tell us, snapped Ford
Strange thing to take
Strange ship
They had arrived at it
The second strangest thing about the ship was  watching  the  Somebody  Else's  Problem field at work
They
could now clearly see the ship for what  it  was  simply  because they  knew  it  was  there
It was quite apparent, however, that
nobody else could
This wasn't because it was actually  invisible or  anything  hyper-impossible like that
The technology involved
in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex  that  nine hundred  and  ninety-nine  thousand  million,  nine  hundred  and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand,  nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of a billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it
The  ultra-famous  sciento-magician  Effrafax of Wug once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the  great  megamountain Magramal entirely invisible
Having spent most of the year jiggling around with  immense  Lux- O-Valves and Refracto-Nullifiers and Spectrum-Bypass-O-Matics, he realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn't going to make it
So, he and  his  friends,  and  his  friends'  friends,  and  his friends'  friends'  friends,  and  his friends' friends' friends' friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to  own  a  major  stellar  trucking  company, put in what now is widely recognized as being the hardest night's work  in  history, and,  sure  enough,  on the following day, Magramal was no longer visible
Effrafax lost his bet - and therefore his life -  simply
because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed (a) that when walking around the area that Magramal ought to be he didn't  trip over  or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious-looking extra moon
The Somebody Else's  Problem  field  is  much  simpler  and  more effective, and what's more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery
This is because  it  relies  on  people's
natural  disposition  not  to  see  anything  they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain
If Effrafax had painted  the
mountain  pink  and  erected  a  cheap and simple Somebody Else's Problem field on it, then  people  would  have  walked  past  the mountain,  round  it, even over it, and simply never have noticed that the thing was there
And this is precisely what was  happening  with  Slartibartfast's ship
It  wasn't  pink, but if it had been, that would have been
the least of its visual problems and people were simply  ignoring it like anything
The most extraordinary thing about it was  that  it  looked  only partly  like  a  spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape hatches and so on, and a great deal like a  small  upended Italian bistro
Ford and Arthur  gazed  up  at  it  with  wonderment  and  deeply offended sensibilities
Yes, I know, said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them  at  that point,  breathless and agitated, but there is a reason
Come, we
must go
The ancient nightmare is come again
Doom  confronts  us all
We must leave at once
I fancy somewhere sunny, said Ford
Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so perplexed  by  what  they  saw  inside  it that they were totally unaware of what happened next outside
A spaceship, yet another one, but  this  one  sleek  and  silver, descended  from  the  sky on to the pitch, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology
It landed gently
It extended a short  ramp
A  tall  grey-green figure  marched  briskly  out  and  approached  the small knot of
people who were gathered in the centre of the  pitch  tending  to the  casualties  of  the recent bizarre massacre
It moved people
aside with quiet, understated authority, and came at  last  to  a man  lying  in  a desperate pool of blood, clearly now beyond the reach of any Earthly medicine, breathing, coughing his last
The
figure knelt down quietly beside him
Arthur Philip Deodat
asked the figure
The man, with horrified confusion in eyes, nodded feebly
You're a no-good dumbo  nothing,  whispered  the  creature
I thought you should know that before you went
Important facts from Galactic history, number two: (Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner's Book  of  popular Galactic History
Since this  Galaxy  began,  vast  civilizations  have  risen  and fallen,  risen  and  fallen,  risen and fallen so often that it's quite tempting to think that life in the Galaxy must be (a) something akin to seasick - space-sick,  time  sick,  history sick or some such thing, and (b) stupid
It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside and let them through
It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the cosmos were streaming through each other
It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of  the  Universe, and that the wind was him
It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the  Universe and that the Universe was a thought of his
It seemed to the people at Lord's  Cricket  Ground  that  another North  London  restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do, and that this was Somebody Else's Problem
What happened
whispered Arthur in considerable awe
We took off, said Slartibartfast
Arthur lay in startled stillness on the  acceleration  couch
He wasn't   certain  whether  he  had  just  got  space-sickness  or
religion
Nice mover, said Ford in an unsuccessful  attempt  to  disguise the   degree   to   which   he   had   been   impressed  by  what Slartibartfast's ship had just done, shame about the decor
For a moment or two the old man didn't reply
He was  staring  at the  instruments  with  the  air  of one who is trying to convert
fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is  burning down
Then  his  brow  cleared and he stared for a moment at the
wide  panoramic  screen  in  front  of  him,  which  displayed  a bewildering  complexity  of  stars  streaming like silver threads around them
His lips moved as if he was trying to spell  something
Suddenly his  eyes  darted  in alarm back to his instruments, but then his
expression merely subsided into a steady frown
He looked back up at  the  screen
He felt his own pulse
His frown deepened for a
moment, then he relaxed
It's a mistake to try  and  understand  mathematics,  he  said, they only worry me
What did you say
Decor, said Ford
Pity about it
Deep in the  fundamental  heart  of  mind  and  Universe,  said
Slartibartfast, there is a reason
Ford glanced sharply around
He clearly thought this  was  taking
an optimistic view of things
The interior of the flight deck was dark green,  dark  red,  dark brown,  cramped and moodily lit
Inexplicably, the resemblance to
a small Italian bistro had failed to end at the  hatchway
Small pools  of light picked out pot plants, glazed tiles and all sorts
of little unidentifiable brass things
Rafia-wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows
The instruments which  had  occupied  Slartibartfast's  attention seemed  to  be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in concrete
Ford reached out and touched it
Fake concrete
Plastic
Fake bottles set in fake concrete
The fundamental heart of mind and Universe  can  take  a  running jump,  he thought to himself, this is rubbish
On the other hand,
it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved  made  the Heart of Gold seem like an electric pram
He swung himself off the  couch
He  brushed  himself  down
He looked at Arthur who was singing quietly to himself
He looked at
the screen and recognized nothing
He looked at Slartibartfast
How far did we just travel
he said
About
said Slartibartfast, about two  thirds  of  the  way across  the Galactic disc, I would say, roughly
Yes, roughly two
thirds, I think
It's a strange thing, said Arthur quietly,  that  the  further
and  faster  one  travels  across  the  Universe,  the more one's position in it seems to be largely immaterial, and one is  filled with a profound, or rather emptied of a
Yes, very strange, said Ford
Where are we going
We are going, said  Slartibartfast,  to  confront  an  ancient
nightmare of the Universe
And where are you going to drop us off
I will need your help
Tough
Look, there's somewhere you can take us where we can have
fun, I'm trying to think of it, we can get drunk and maybe listen to some extremely evil music
Hold on, I'll look it up
He  dug
out  his copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and tipped through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and rock and roll
A curse has arisen from the mists of time, said Slartibartfast
Yes,  I  expect  so,  said  Ford
Hey,  he  said,   lighting accidentally  on  one  particular  reference  entry,  Eccentrica
Gallumbits, did you ever meet her
The triple-breasted  whore  of Eroticon Six
Some people say her erogenous zones start some four
miles from her actual body
Me, I disagree, I say five
A curse, said Slartibartfast, which will engulf the Galaxy  in
fire  and  destruction,  and  possibly  bring  the  Universe to a premature doom
I mean it, he added
Sounds like a bad time, said Ford, with  look  I'll  be  drunk enough  not to notice
Here, he said, stabbing his finger at the
screen of the Guide, would be a really wicked place to go, and I think  we  should
What do you say, Arthur
Stop mumbling mantras
and pay attention
There's important stuff you're missing here
Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head
Where are we going
he said
To confront an ancient night- Can it, said Ford
Arthur, we are going out into the Galaxy to
have some fun
Is that an idea you can cope with
What's Slartibartfast looking so anxious about
said Arthur
Nothing, said Ford
Doom,  said  Slartibartfast
Come,  he  added,  with  sudden authority, there is much I must show and tell you
He walked towards  a  green  wrought-iron  spiral  staircase  set incomprehensibly  in the middle of the flight deck and started to ascend
Arthur, with a frown, followed
Ford slung the Guide sullenly back into his satchel
My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland  and  a natural  deficiency in moral fibre, he muttered to himself, and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes
Nevertheless, he stomped up the stairs behind them
What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so  it  seemed,  and Ford  shook  his  head,  buried his face in his hands and slumped against a pot plant, crushing it against the wall
The   central   computational   area,    said    Slartibartfast unperturbed,  this is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed
Yes I know what it looks like, but it is
in  fact a complex four-dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex mathematical functions
It looks like a joke, said Arthur
I know what it looks like, said Slartibartfast, and  went  into it
As  he  did  so,  Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it
might mean, but he refused to believe it
The Universe could  not possibly  work  like  that, he thought, cannot possibly
That, he
thought to himself, would be as absurd as
he terminated  that line of thinking
Most of the really absurd things he could think
of had already happened
And this was one of them
It was a large glass cage, or box - in fact a room
In it was a table, a long one
Around it were  gathered  about  a dozen  chairs,  of the bentwood style
On it was a tablecloth - a
grubby,  red  and  white  check  tablecloth,  scarred  with   the occasional   cigarette  burn,  each,  presumably,  at  a  precise calculated mathematical position
And on the tablecloth sat some half-eaten Italian  meals,  hedged about with half-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine, and toyed with listlessly by robots
It was  all  completely  artificial
The  robot  customers  were attended  by  a  robot  waiter,  a  robot wine waiter and a robot
maetre  d'
The  furniture  was   artificial,   the   tablecloth artificial, and each particular piece of food was clearly capable
of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a pollo sorpreso, without actually being one
And all participated in a  little  dance  together  -  a  complex routine  involving the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets, cheque books, credit cards, watches, pencils and  paper  napkins, which  seemed  to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence, but never actually getting anywhere
Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time  of day  quite  idly  with  the maetre d', whilst one of the customer robots, an autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning what he intended to do to some guy over some girl
Slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and passed a shrewd eye over the menu
The tempo of the routine round
the table seemed  somehow  imperceptibly  to  quicken
Arguments broke  out,  people  attempted  to  prove things on napkins
They
waved fiercely at each  other,  and  attempted  to  examine  each other's pieces of chicken
The waiter's hand began to move on the
bill pad more quickly than a human hand could  manage,  and  then more quickly than a human eye could follow
The pace accelerated
Soon, an extraordinary and insistent politeness  overwhelmed  the group, and seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly achieved
A new vibration thrilled through the ship
Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room
Bistromathics, he said
The most powerful computational  force known   to   parascience
Come  to  the  Room  of  Informational
Illusions
He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake
The Bistromatic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing  vast interstellar  distances  without all that dangerous mucking about with Improbability Factors
Bistromathics  itself  is  simply  a  revolutionary  new  way  of understanding the behaviour of numbers
Just as Einstein observed
that time was not an absolute  but  depended  on  the  observer's movement  in  space,  and  that  space  was  not an absolute, but depended on the  observer's  movement  in  time,  so  it  is  now realized  that  numbers  are  not  absolute,  but  depend  on the observer's movement in restaurants
The first non-absolute number is the number of  people  for  whom the  table  is  reserved
This will vary during the course of the
first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then  bear  no apparent  relation  to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the number of people who subsequently join them  after  the show/match/party/gig,  or  to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up
The second non-absolute number is  the  given  time  of  arrival, which   is  now  known  to  be  one  of  those  most  bizarre  of mathematical concepts,  a  recipriversexcluson,  a  number  whose existence  can  only  be  defined  as  being  anything other than itself
In other words, the given time  of  arrival  is  the  one
moment  of  time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive
Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part  in
many  branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic  equations  used  to  engineer  the  Somebody Else's Problem field
The third and most mysterious piece of  non-absoluteness  of  all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people  at  the  table,  and what they are each prepared to pay for
The number of people who
have actually brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in  this field
The baffling discrepancies which used  to  occur  at  this  point remained  uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously
They were at the time put down to such things  as
politeness,    rudeness,    meanness,    flashness,    tiredness, emotionality,  or  the  lateness  of  the  hour,  and  completely forgotten  about on the following morning
They were never tested
under  laboratory  conditions,  of  course,  because  they  never occurred  in  laboratories  -  not  in  reputable laboratories at least
And so it was only with the advent of pocket computers  that  the startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this: Numbers written  on  restaurant  bills  within  the  confines  of restaurants  do  not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other  parts  of  the Universe
This  single  fact  took  the  scientific  world  by  storm
It completely  revolutionized  it
So many mathematical conferences
got held in such good restaurants that many of the  finest  minds of a generation died of obesity and heart failure and the science of maths was put back by years
Slowly, however,  the  implications  of  the  idea  began  to  be understood
To  begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too
much what the man in the street would have said, Oh yes, I could have  told  you that, about
Then some phrases like Interactive
Subjectivity Frameworks were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get on with it
The small groups of monks who had taken  up  hanging  around  the major  research  institutes  singing strange chants to the effect that the Universe was only a figment of its own imagination  were eventually given a street theatre grant and went away
In space travel, you see, said Slartibartfast,  as  he  fiddled with some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions, in space travel
He stopped and looked about him
The Room of Informational Illusions was a  welcome  relief  after the visual monstrosities of the central computational area
There
was nothing in it
No information, no illusions, just themselves, white  walls  and a few small instruments which looked as if they
were meant to plug into something which  Slartibartfast  couldn't find
Yes
urged Arthur
He had picked up Slartibartfast's  sense  of urgency but didn't know what to do with it
Yes what
said the old man
You were saying
Slartibartfast looked at him sharply
The numbers, he said, are awful
He resumed his search
Arthur nodded wisely to himself
After a while he  realized  that this  wasn't  getting  him anywhere and decided that he would say
what
after all
In space travel, repeated Slartibartfast, all the numbers  are awful
Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help,  but  Ford was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it
I was only, said Slartibartfast with a sigh,  trying  to  save you the trouble of asking me why all the ship's computations were being done on a waiter's bill pad
Arthur frowned
Why, he said, were all the ship's computations being done on a wait- He stopped
Slartibartfast said, Because in space travel all the numbers are awful
He could tell that he wasn't getting his point across
Listen, he said
On a waiter's bill  pad  numbers  dance
You must have encountered the phenomenon
Well
On a waiter's  bill  pad,  said  Slartibartfast,  reality  and
unreality  collide  on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible, within certain parameters
What parameters
It's impossible to say, said  Slartibartfast
That's  one  of
them
Strange  but  true
At  least,  I think it's strange, he added, and I'm assured that it's true
At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which  he  had been  searching,  and  clicked the instrument he was holding into it
Do not be alarmed, he said, and then suddenly darted an alarmed look at himself, and lunged back, it's
They didn't hear what he said, because at that  moment  the  ship winked  out  of  existence  around them and a starbattle-ship the size of a small Midlands  industrial  city  plunged  out  of  the sundered night towards them, star lasers ablaze
They gaped, pop-eyed, and were unable to scream
Another world, another day, another dawn
The early morning's thinnest sliver of light appeared silently
Several billion trillion  tons  of  superhot  exploding  hydrogen nuclei  rose  slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and slightly damp
There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there  is  the possibility of magic
Creation holds its breath
The moment passed as it regularly  did  on  Squornshellous  Zeta, without incident
The mist clung to the surface of the  marshes
The  swamp  trees were  grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct
It hung motionless
like held breath
Nothing moved
There was silence
The sun struggled feebly with the mist, tried to impart a  little warmth  here,  shed  a  little light there, but clearly today was going to be just another long haul across the sky
Nothing moved
Again, silence
Nothing moved
Silence
Very often on Squornshellous Zeta, whole days would  go  on  like this, and this was indeed going to be one of them
Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort
And a few hours later it reappeared, squared  its  shoulders  and started on up the sky again
This time, however, something was happening
A mattress had  just met a robot
Hello, robot, said the mattress
Bleah, said the robot and continued what it  was  doing,  which was walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle
Happy
said the mattress
The robot stopped and looked at the mattress
It  looked  at  it quizzically
It  was  clearly  a very stupid mattress
It looked
back at him with wide eyes
After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general contempt for all things mattressy, the robot  continued  to  walk round in tight circles
We could have a conversation, said  the  mattress,  would  you like that
It was a large mattress, and probably one of quite high  quality
Very  few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an infinitely large Universe such as, for instance,  the  one  in which  we live, most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not,  grow  somewhere
A  forest  was
discovered  recently  in  which  most  of  the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit
The life  cycle  of  ratchet  screwdriver
fruit  it  quite  interesting
Once picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years
Then one  night
it  suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal object with  flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole for a screw
This, when found, will get thrown away
No one knows
what  it  is  supposed to gain from this
Nature, in her infinite wisdom, is presumably working on it
No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from  their lives  either
They are large, friendly, pocket-sprung creatures
which live quiet private lives in the marshes  of  Squornshellous Zeta
Many  of  them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped
out and slept on
None of them seem to mind and all of  them  are called Zem
No, said Marvin
My name, said the mattress,  is  Zem
We  could  discuss  the weather a little
Marvin paused again in his weary circular plod
The dew, he observed, has clearly fallen with  a  particularly sickening thud this morning
He resumed his  walk,  as  if  inspired  by  this  conversational outburst  to  fresh  heights of gloom and despondency
He plodded
tenaciously
If he had had teeth he would have  gritted  them  at this point
He hadn't
He didn't
The mere plod said it all
The mattress flolloped around
This is a  thing  that  only  live mattresses in swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not
in more common usage
It flolloped in a sympathetic  sort of way, moving  a  fairish  body  of  water  as  it did so
It blew a few
bubbles up through the  water  engagingly
Its  blue  and  white stripes  glistened briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had
unexpectedly made it through the mist, causing  the  creature  to bask momentarily
Marvin plodded
You have something on your mind, I  think,  said  the  mattress floopily
More  than  you  can  possibly  imagine,  dreaded  Marvin
My capacity  for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the
infinite reaches  of  space  itself
Except  of  course  for  my capacity for happiness
Stomp, stomp, he went
My capacity for happiness, he added,  you  could  fit  into  a matchbox without taking out the matches first
The mattress globbered
This is the noise made by a live,  swamp- dwelling  mattress  that  is  deeply moved by a story of personal
tragedy
The word  can  also,  according  to  The  Ultra-Complete Maximegalon  Dictionary  of  Every  Language Ever, mean the noise
made by the Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop on discovering that he has  forgotten  his  wife's birthday for the second year running
Since there was only ever one Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop, and he  never  married,  the  word is only ever used in a negative or speculative sense,  and  there  is  an  ever-increasing  body  of opinion   which   holds   that   The  Ultra-Complete  Maximegalon Dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to cart its microstored  edition  around in
Strangely enough, the dictionary
omits the word floopily, which simply means in the  manner  of something which is floopy
The mattress globbered again
I sense a deep dejection in your diodes, it  vollued  (for  the meaning  of  the  word  vollue,  buy  a  copy of Squornshellous Swamptalk at any remaindered bookshop, or alternatively  buy  The Ultra-Complete  Maximegalon Dictionary, as the University will be very glad to get it off their  hands  and  regain  some  valuable parking   lots),   and   it  saddens  me
You  should  be  more
mattresslike
We live quiet retired lives in the swamp, where  we are  content  to  flollop  and vollue and regard the wetness in a
fairly floopy manner
Some of us are killed, but all  of  us  are called Zem, so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to
a minimum
Why are you walking in circles
Because my leg is stuck, said Marvin simply
It seems to me, said the mattress  eyeing  it  compassionately, that it is a pretty poor sort of leg
You are right, said Marvin, it is
Voon, said the mattress
I expect so, said Marvin, and I also expect that you find  the idea of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing
You should
tell your friends Zem and Zem when you see  them  later;  they'll laugh,  if  I know them, which I don't of course - except insofar as I know all organic life forms, which is  much  better  than  I would wish to
Ha, but my life is but a box of wormgears
He stomped around again in his tiny circle, around his thin steel peg-leg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck
But why do you just keep walking  round  and  round
said  the mattress
Just to make the point, said Marvin, and continued,  round  and round
Consider it  made,  my  dear  friend,  flurbled  the  mattress, consider it made
Just another million years, said Marvin,  just  another  quick million
Then I might try it backwards
Just for the variety, you
understand
The mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that
the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in this futile and  fruitless  manner,  and  with  another  quiet flurble he did so
Oh, just over the one-point-five-million mark, just over,  said Marvin airily
Ask me if I ever get bored, go on, ask me
The mattress did
Marvin  ignored  the  question,  he  merely  trudged  with  added emphasis
I  gave  a  speech  once,  he  said  suddenly,  and  apparently unconnectedly
You may not instantly see why I bring the subject
up, but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you
Let me give you an example
Think of a number, any number
Er, five, said the mattress
Wrong, said Marvin
You see
The mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it  was
in  the  presence  of a not unremarkable mind
It willomied along its entire length, sending excited  little  ripples  through  its
shallow algae-covered pool
It gupped
Tell me, it urged, of the speech you once made, I long to hear it
It was received very badly, said  Marvin,  for  a  variety  of reasons
I  delivered  it, he added, pausing to make an awkward
humping sort of gesture with his not-exactly-good  arm,  but  his arm which was better than the other one which was dishearteningly welded to his left side, over there, about a mile distance
He was pointing as well as he  could  manage,  and  he  obviously wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could manage, through the mist, over the reeds, to a part of the  marsh which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh
There, he repeated
I was  somewhat  of  a  celebrity  at  the time
Excitement gripped the mattress
It had never heard  of  speeches being  delivered  on  Squornshellous  Zeta,  and certainly not by
celebrities
Water spattered off it as a thrill  glurried  across its back
It did something which  mattresses  very  rarely  bother  to  do
Summoning  every  bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body, heaved it up into the air and held it quivering there for  a  few seconds  whilst  it peered through the mist over the reeds at the part of the marsh which Marvin had indicated, observing,  without disappointment,  that it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh
The effort was too much, and it flodged  back  into
its pool, deluging Marvin with smelly mud, moss and weeds
I was a celebrity, droned the robot sadly, for a  short  while on  account  of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing  sun
You
can  guess  from  my  condition, he added, how narrow my escape was
I was rescued by a scrap-metal merchant, imagine that
Here
I am, brain the size of
never mind
He trudged savagely for a few seconds
He it was who fixed me up with this leg
Hateful, isn't  it
He sold  me to a Mind Zoo
I was the star exhibit
I had to sit on a
box and tell my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive
Give us a grin, little robot,' they would shout at me,
give us a little chuckle
I would explain to them that  to  get my  face  to  grin wold take a good couple of hours in a workshop
with a wrench, and that went down very well
The speech, urged the mattress
I long to hear of  the  speech
you gave in the marshes
There was a bridge built across the marshes
A  cyberstructured
hyperbridge,  hundreds  of  miles in length, to carry ion-buggies and freighters over the swamp
A bridge
quirruled the mattress
Here in the swamp
A bridge, confirmed Marvin, here in the swamp
It was going to
revitalize  the  economy of the Squornshellous System
They spent the entire economy of the Squornshellous System building it
They
asked me to open it
Poor fools
It began to rain a little, a fine spray slid through the mist
I stood on the platform
For hundreds of miles in front  of  me, and hundreds of miles behind me, the bridge stretched
Did it glitter
enthused the mattress
It glittered
Did it span the miles majestically
It spanned the miles majestically
Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into  the  invisible
mist
Yes, said Marvin
Do you want to hear this story
I want to hear your speech, said the mattress
This is what I said
I said, `I would like to say that it  is  a very  great  pleasure,  honour  and privilege for me to open this
bridge, but I can't because my lying  circuits  are  all  out  of commission
I  hate  and  despise  you  all
I now declare this
hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of  all  who wantonly  cross  her
And  I  plugged  myself  into the opening
circuits
Marvin paused, remembering the moment
The mattress flurred  and  glurried
It  flolloped,  gupped  and willomied, doing this last in a particularly floopy way
Voon, it wurfed at last
And it was a magnificent occasion
Reasonably magnificent
The  entire  thousand-mile-long  bridge
spontaneously  folded  up  its  glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire, taking everybody with it
There was  a  sad  and  terrible  pause  at  this  point  in  the conversation  during  which  a  hundred  thousand  people  seemed unexpectedly to say wop and a team of  white  robots  descended from  the  sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation
For a sudden violent  moment  they  were  all
there,  in  the swamp, wrenching Marvin's false leg off, and then they were gone again in their ship, which said foop
You see the sort of thing I have to contend with
said  Marvin to the gobbering mattress
Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for  another violent  incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone in the swamp
He  flolloped  around  in  astonishment  and
alarm
He  almost lurgled in fear
He reared himself to see over the reeds, but there was nothing to  see,  just  more  reeds
He
listened,  but  there  was  no  sound  on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of half-crazed etymologists calling  distantly  to each other across the sullen mire
The body of Arthur Dent span
The Universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it,  and  each  particular  shard span silently through the void, reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction
And then the blackness behind the  Universe  exploded,  and  each particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell
And the nothingness behind  the  blackness  behind  the  Universe erupted,  and  behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the shattered Universe was at last the dark figure of an  immense man speaking immense words
These, then,  said  the  figure,  speaking  from  an  immensely comfortable   chair,   were   the  Krikkit  Wars,  the  greatest devastation  ever  visited  upon  our  Galaxy
What   you   have
experienced
Slartibartfast floated past, waving
It's just a documentary, he called out
This  is  not  a  good bit
Terribly sorry, trying to find the rewind control
is what billions of billions of innocent
Do not, called out  Slartibartfast  floating  past  again,  and
fiddling furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the Room of Informational Illusions  and  which  was  in  fact still stuck there, agree to buy anything at this point
people, creatures, your fellow beings
Music swelled - again, it was immense music, immense chords
And
behind the man, slowly, three tall pillars began to emerge out of the immensely swirling mist
experienced, lived through - or, more often, failed to  live through
Think  of that, my friends
And let us not forget - and
in just a moment I shall be able to suggest a way which will help us  always to remember - that before the Krikkit Wars, the Galaxy was that rare and wonderful thing a happy Galaxy
The music was going bananas with immensity at this point
A Happy Galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of  the Wikkit Gate
The three pillars stood out clearly  now,  three  pillars  topped with two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to Arthur's addled brain
The three pillars, thundered the man
The Steel  Pillar  which represented the Strength and Power of the Galaxy
Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and  down  the pillar on the left which was, clearly, made of steel or something very like it
The music thumped and bellowed
The Perspex Pillar, announced the man, representing the forces of Science and Reason in the Galaxy
Other searchlights played exotically up and down  the  righthand, transparent  pillar  creating  dazzling  patterns within it and a sudden inexplicable craving  for  ice-cream  in  the  stomach  of Arthur Dent
And,  the  thunderous  voice  continued,  the  Wooden  Pillar, representing
and  here his voice became just very slightly
hoarse with wonderful  sentiments,  the  forces  of  Nature  and Spirituality
The lights picked out the central pillar
The music moved bravely up into the realms of complete unspeakability
Between them supporting, the voice rolled on,  approaching  its climax,  the  Golden  Bail  of Prosperity and the Silver Bail of Peace
The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the music  had  now,  fortunately,  gone far beyond the limits of the discernible
At the top of the three pillars the two  brilliantly
gleaming  bails sat and dazzled
There seemed to be girls sitting on top of them, or maybe they were meant to be angels
Angels are
usually represented as wearing more than that, though
Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was  presumably  meant to be the Cosmos, and a darkening of the lights
There is not a world, thrilled the man's expert voice,  not  a civilized  world  in  the Galaxy where this symbol is not revered even today
Even  in  primitive  worlds  it  persists  in  racial
memories
This  it was that the forces of Krikkit destroyed, and this it is that now locks  their  world  away  till  the  end  of
eternity
And with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the
Wikkit  gate
Scale  was  terribly  hard  to judge in this whole extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must  have
been about three feet high
Not the original key, of course
That, as  everyone  knows,  was destroyed,  blasted  into  the ever-whirling eddies of the space-
time continuum and lost for ever
This is a  remarkable  replica, hand-tooled   by  skilled  craftsmen,  lovingly  assembled  using
ancient craft secrets into a memento you will be proud to own, in memory  of  those  who  fell,  and in tribute to the Galaxy - our Galaxy - which they died to defend
Slartibartfast floated past again at this moment
Found it, he said
We can lose all this  rubbish
Just  don't nod, that's all
Now, let us bow our heads in payment, intoned  the  voice,  and then said it again, much faster and backwards
Lights came and went, the pillars  disappeared,  the  man  gabled himself backwards into nothing, the Universe snappily reassembled itself around them
You get the gist
said Slartibartfast
I'm astonished, said Arthur, and bewildered
I was asleep, said Ford, who floated into view at  this  point
Did I miss anything
They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on  the
edge  of  an  agonizingly  high  cliff
The wind whipped out from their faces and across a bay on which the remains of one  of  the
greatest  and most powerful space battle-fleets ever assembled in the Galaxy was briskly burning itself back  into  existence
The
sky  was  a sullen pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to blue and upwards to black
Smoke billowed down out of  it  at  an
incredible lick
Events were now passing back by them almost  too  quickly  to  be distinguished,  and when, a short while later, a huge starbattle- ship rushed away from them as if they'd  said  boo,  they  only just recognized it as the point at which they had come in
But now things were too rapid, a video-tactile blur which brushed and  jiggled them through centuries of galactic history, turning, twisting, flickering
The sound was a mere thin thrill
Periodically through the thickening jumble of events they  sensed appalling  catastrophes,  deep  horrors,  cataclysmic shocks, and these were always associated with certain recurring  images,  the only  images  which  ever  stood out clearly from the avalance of tumbling history: a wicket gate, a  small  hard  red  ball,  hard white  robots,  and  also something less distinct, something dark and cloudy
But there was also another sensation which rose  clearly  out  of the thrilling passage of time
Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded  up  will  lose  the definition  of  each  individual  click and gradually take on the quality of a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion - and yet not an emotion
If it  was  an  emotion,  it  was  a  totally
emotionless  one
It was hatred, implacable hatred
It was cold, not like ice is cold, but like a wall is cold
It was impersonal,
not as a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a computer-issued parking summons is impersonal
And it was  deadly
again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly, but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly
And just as a rising tone will change in character  and  take  on harmonics  as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a scream of guilt and failure
And suddenly it stopped
They were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening
The sun was setting
All around them softly undulating green  countryside  rolled  off gently  into  the distance
Birds sang about what they thought of
it all, and the general opinion seemed to be good
A  little  way away  could  be heard the sound of children playing, and a little
further away than the apparent source of that sound could be seen in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town
The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings  made of white stone
The skyline was of gentle pleasing curves
The sun had nearly set
As if out of nowhere, music began
Slartibartfast  tugged  at  a switch and it stopped
A voice said, This
Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped
I will tell you about it, he said quietly
The place was peaceful
Arthur  felt  happy
Even  Ford  seemed cheerful
They  walked a short way in the direction of the town,
and the Informational Illusion of  the  grass  was  pleasant  and springy  under  their feet, and the Informational Illusion of the flowers smelt sweet  and  fragrant
Only  Slartibartfast  seemed
apprehensive and out of sorts
He stopped and looked up
It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this  did  at  the end,  so to speak, or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just blurredly experienced, something nasty must be about  to happen
He  was  distressed  to think that something nasty could
happen to somewhere as idyllic as this
He too glanced up
There was nothing in the sky
They're not about  to  attack  here,  are  they
he  said
He realized that this was merely a recording he was walking through,
but he still felt alarmed
Nothing is about to attack here, said Slartibartfast in a voice which  unexpectedly  trembled with emotion
This is where it all
started
This is the place itself
This is Krikkit
He stared up into the sky
The sky, from one horizon to another, from  east  to  west,  from north to south, was utterly and completely black
Stomp stomp
Whirrr
Pleased to be of service
Shut up
Thank you
Stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp
Whirrr
Thank you for making a simple door very happy
Hope your diodes rot
Thank you
Have a nice day
Stomp stomp stomp stomp

It is my pleasure to open for you
Zark off
and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge  of  a job well done
I said zark off
Thank you for listening to this message
Stomp stomp stomp stomp
Wop
Zaphod stopped stomping
He had been stomping around the Heart of
Gold  for  days, and so far no door had said wop to him
He was fairly certain that no door had said wop to him now
It was not
the  sort  of  thing  doors said
Too concise
Furthermore, there were not enough doors
It sounded as if a hundred thousand people
had  said wop, which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship
It was dark
Most of the ship's non-essential systems were closed down
It was drifting in a remote area of the Galaxy, deep in the
inky blackness of space
So  which  particular  hundred  thousand people  would  turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected
wop
He looked about him, up the corridor and down  the  corridor
It was  all  in  deep  shadow
There were just the very dim pinkish
outlines of the  doors  which  glowed  in  the  dark  and  pulsed whenever they spoke, though he had tried every way he could think of of stopping them
The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each other,  because  neither  of  them  was  currently a particularly engaging sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking into his soul
It had indeed been an error
It had been  late  one  night  -  of course
It had been a difficult day - of course
There had been soulful music playing on the ship's sound system - of course
And he had, of course, been slightly drunk
In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of soul-searching  had  applied,  but  it had, nevertheless, clearly been an error
Standing now, silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered the  moment  and  shivered
His  one head looked one way and his
other the other and each decided that the other was  the  way  to go
He listened but could hear nothing
All there had been was the wop
It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of people just to say one word
He started nervously to edge his way  in  the  direction  of  the bridge
There  at  least  he  would  feel in control
He stopped
again
The way he was feeling he didn't think he was  an  awfully good person to be in control
The  first  shock  of  that  moment,  thinking  back,  had   been discovering that he actually had a soul
In fact he'd always more or less assumed that he had  one  as  he had  a  full  complement  of  everything  else, and indeed two of somethings, but suddenly actually to encounter the thing  lurking there deep within him had giving him a severe jolt
And then to discover (this was the second shock) that  it  wasn't the  totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a natural right to expect had jolted him again
Then he had thought about what his position actually was and  the renewed  shock had nearly made him spill his drink
He drained it
quickly before anything serious  happened  to  it
He  then  had another  quick one to follow the first one down and check that it
was all right
Freedom, he said aloud
Trillian came on to the bridge at that  point  and  said  several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom
I can't cope with it, he said darkly, and sent  a  third  drink down  to  see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition of the first
He looked uncertainly at both of her and  preferred
the one on the right
He poured a drink down his other throat with  the  plan  that  it would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together they would get the second to pull  itself  together
Then  all  three  would  go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well
He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink  had  understood all  that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully and a sixth for moral support
You're drinking too much, said Trillian
His heads collided trying to sort out the four of  her  he  could now  see  into  a  whole  position
He gave up and looked at the
navigation screen and was astonished to see  a  quite  phenomenal number of stars
Excitement and adventure and really wild things, he muttered
Look, she said in a sympathetic tone of  voice,  and  sat  down near  him, it's quite understandable that you're going to feel a little aimless for a bit
He boggled at her
He had never seen anyone sit on their own  lap before
Wow, he said
He had another drink
You've finished the mission you've been on for years
I haven't been on it
I've tried to avoid being on it
You've still finished it
He grunted
There seemed to be a terrific party going on  in  his
stomach
I think it finished me, he said
Here I am, Zaphod Beeblebrox, I  can  go anywhere, do anything
I have the greatest ship in the
know sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working  out  pretty well
Are they
As far as I can tell I'm not an expert in personal relationships
Trillian raised her eyebrows
I am, he added, one hell of a guy, I can do  anything  I  want only I just don't have the faintest idea what
He paused
One thing, he further added, has suddenly ceased  to  lead  to another  -  in  contradiction  of which he had another drink and slid gracelessly off his chair
Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a  little  research  in  the ship's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
It had some
advice to offer on drunkenness
Go to it, it said, and good luck
It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size  of  the
Universe and ways of coping with that
Then she found the entry on Han Wavel, an exotic holiday  planet, and one of the wonders of the Galaxy
Han Wavel is a world which consists largely  of  fabulous  ultra- luxury  hotels  and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and rain
The chances of this happening are more or less  one  to  infinity against
Little  is known of how this came about because none of
the geophysicists, probability statisticians,  meteoranalysts  or bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there
Terrific, thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the great white running-shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy spaceport
The  ship  was  clearly  causing  a  sensation on the
ground, and Trillian  was  enjoying  herself
She  heard  Zaphod moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship
How are you
she said over the general intercom
Fine, he said brightly, terribly well
Where are you
In the bathroom
What are you doing
Staying here
After an hour or two it became plain that he  meant  it  and  the
ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway
Heigh ho, said Eddie the Computer
Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple  of  times and pushed the intercom switch
I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at  this point
Probably not, replied Zaphod from wherever he was
I think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you  out  of yourself
Whatever you think, I think, said Zaphod
Recreational  Impossibilities  was  a  heading   which   caught Trillian's  eye  when,  a short while later, she sat down to flip through the Guide again, and as  the  Heart  of  Gold  rushed  at improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup of something undrinkable from the Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser  and read about how to fly
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has  this  to  say  on  the subject of flying
There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying
The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself  at  the  ground and miss
Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it
The first part is easy
All it requires is simply the ability to throw  yourself  forward with  all  your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt
That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground
Most people fail to miss the  ground,  and  if  they  are  really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard
Clearly, it's the second point, the missing, which  presents  the difficulties
One problem is that you have to  miss  the  ground  accidentally
It's  no  good  deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't
You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by
something  else  when  you're  halfway  there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about  how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it
It is notoriously difficult to prise  your  attention  away  from these  three  things  during  the  split  second you have at your disposal
Hence  most  people's  failure,  and  their   eventual
disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport
If,  however,  you  are  lucky  enough  to  have  your  attention momentarily  distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species  of  beetle  crawling along  a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches  above  it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner
This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration
Bob and float, float and bob
Ignore all considerations of  your  own  weight  and  simply  let yourself waft higher
Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this  point  because they are unlikely to say anything helpful
They are most likely to say something along the lines  of,  Good God, you can't possibly be flying
It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right
Waft higher and higher
Try a few swoops, gentle ones at  first,  then  drift  above  the treetops breathing regularly
Do not wave at anybody
When you have done this a few times you will find the  moment  of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve
You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight,  your  speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do,  but just allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway
You will also learn how to land properly, which is something  you will  almost  certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first attempt
There are private flying  clubs  you  can  join  which  help  you achieve the all-important moment of distraction
They hire people
with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and  exhibit  and/or  explain  them  at  the crucial moments
Few
genuine hitch-hikers will be able to afford to join these  clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them
Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod wasn't  really  in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or for walking  through  mountains  or  for  trying  to  get  the Brantisvogan  Civil  Service  to  acknowledge a change-of-address card, which were  the  other  things  listed  under  the  heading Recreational Impossibilities
Instead, she flew the ship to Allosimanius  Syneca,  a  world  of ice,  snow, mind-hurtling beauty and stunning cold
The trek from
the snow plains of  Liska  to  the  summit  of  the  Ice  Crystal Pyramids  of  Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet skis and a team of Syneca Snowhounds, but the view  from  the  top,  a view which takes in the Stin Glacier Fields, the shimmering Prism Mountains and the far ethereal dancing icelights,  is  one  which first  freezes  the  mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty, and  Trillian,  for  one,  felt that  she  could do with a bit of having her mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty
They went into a low orbit
There lay the silverwhite beauty of Allosimanius  Syneca  beneath them
Zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow  and  the other doing crosswords till late into the night
Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a  sufficiently  high number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to get Zaphod talking
She prepared, by dint  of  deactivating  all  the  robot  kitchen synthomatics,  the  most  fabulously  delicious  meal  she  could contrive -  delicately  oiled  meals,  scented  fruits,  fragrant cheeses, fine Aldebaran wines
She carried it through to him and asked if he felt  like  talking things through
Zark off, said Zaphod
Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an  even  higher number,  tossed  the  tray lightly aside, walked to the transport room and just teleported herself the hell out of his life
She  didn't  even  programme  any  coordinates,  she  hadn't  the faintest  idea  where she was going, she just went - a random row of dots flowing through the Universe
Anything, she said to herself as  she  left,  is  better  than this
Good job too, muttered  Zaphod  to  himself,  turned  over  and failed to go to sleep
The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship, pretending  not to look for her, though he knew she wasn't there
He ignored the computer's querulous demands to know just what the hell  was  going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag across a pair of its terminals
After a while he began to turn down the lights
There was nothing to see
Nothing was about to happen
Lying in bed one night - and night was now  virtually  continuous on  the ship - he decided to pull himself together, to get things into some kind of perspective
He sat up sharply and  started  to
pull  clothes  on
He  decided that there must be someone in the Universe feeling  more  wretched,  miserable  and  forsaken  than
himself, and he determined to set out and find him
Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, and he returned to bed
It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped  disconsolately about  the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he heard the wop said, and it made him very nervous
He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man trying  to  unbend  a  corkscrew  by  telekinesis
He  laid  his
fingertips against the wall and felt an  unusual  vibration
And now  he  could  quite  clearly hear slight noises, and could hear
where they were coming from - they were coming from the bridge
Computer
he hissed
Mmmm
said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly
Is there someone on this ship
Mmmmm, said the computer
Who is it
Mmmmm mmm mmmmm, said the computer
What
Mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm
Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands
Oh, Zarquon, he muttered to himself
Then  he  stared  up  the corridor  towards  the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance
from which more and purposeful noises were coming, and  in  which the gagged terminals were situated
Computer, he hissed again
Mmmmm
When I ungag you
Mmmmm
Remind me to punch myself in the mouth
Mmmmm mmm
Either one
Now just tell me this
One for yes, two for  no
Is
it dangerous
Mmmmm
It is
Mmmm
You didn't just go `mmmm' twice
Mmmm mmmm
Hmmmm
He inched his way up the  corridor  as  if  he  would  rather  be
yarding his way down it, which was true
He was within two yards  of  the  door  to  the  bridge  when  he suddenly  realized  to his horror that it was going to be nice to him, and he stopped dead
He hadn't been able  to  turn  off  the
doors' courtesy voice circuits
This doorway to the bridge was  concealed  from  view  within  it because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to  curve  round,  and  he  had  been  hoping  to  enter unobserved
He leant despondently back against the wall again and  said  some words which his other head was quite shocked to hear
He peered at the dim pink outline of  the  door,  and  discovered that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the Sensor Field which extended out into the  corridor  and  told the  door  when there was someone there for whom it must open and to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark
He pressed himself hard back against the wall and  edged  himself towards  the  door,  flattening  his chest as much as he possibly could to avoid brushing against the very, very dim  perimeter  of the  field
He  held  his  breath,  and congratulated himself on
having lain in bed sulking for the  last  few  days  rather  than trying  to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ship's gym
He then realized he was going to have to speak at this point
He took a series of  very  shallow  breaths,  and  then  said  as quickly  and  as  quietly as he could, Door, if you can hear me, say so very, very quietly
Very, very quietly, the door murmured, I can hear you
Good
Now, in a moment, I'm going to ask you to open
When  you
open I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK
OK
And I don't want you to say to me that I have made a simple door very  happy,  or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your satisfaction to close again with the  knowledge  of  a  job  well done, OK
OK
And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand
I understand
OK, said Zaphod, tensing himself, open now
The door slid open quietly
Zaphod slipped quietly  through
The door closed quietly behind him
Is that the way you like it, Mr Beeblebrox
said the  door  out loud
I want you to imagine, said Zaphod to the group of white robots who  swung  round  to stare at him at that point, that I have an extremely powerful Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in my hand
There was an  immensely  cold  and  savage  silence
The  robots regarded  him  with  hideously  dead eyes
They stood very still
There was something intensely  macabre  about  their  appearance, especially  to Zaphod who had never seen one before or even known anything about them
The Krikkit Wars  belonged  to  the  ancient
past  of  the  Galaxy,  and  Zaphod  had  spent most of his early history lessons plotting how he was going to have  sex  with  the girl  in  the  cybercubicle  next  to him, and since his teaching computer had been an integral part of this plot it had eventually had  all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely different set of ideas  which  had  then  resulted  in  it  being scrapped  and sent to a home for Degenerate Cybermats, whither it was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen  deeply  in love  with  the  unfortunate  machine,  with  the result (a) that Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a  period of  ancient  history that would have been of inestimable value to him at this moment
He stared at them in shock
It was impossible to explain why,  but  their  smooth  and  sleek white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil
From their hideously dead eyes to their  powerful  lifeless
feet,  they  were  clearly  the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to kill
Zaphod gulped in cold fear
They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall,  and  had forced  a  passage through some of the vital innards of the ship
Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and worse  sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very heart of the ship, the heart of the Improbability Drive that  had been  so  mysteriously created out of thin air, the Heart of Gold itself
The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a  way  as  to suggest  that  it  was  measuring  every smallest particle of his body, mind and capability
And when it spoke, what it said seemed
to  bear this impression out
Before going on to what it actually said, it is worth recording at this point  that  Zaphod  was  the
first  living  organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over  ten  billion  years
If  he  had  paid  more
attention  to his ancient history lessons and less to his organic being, he might have been more impressed by this honour
The robot's voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless
It had  almost  a  cultured  rasp to it
It sounded as ancient as it
was
It said, You do have a Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in your hand
Zaphod didn't know what it  meant  for  a  moment,  but  then  he
glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to a  wall  bracket  was  indeed  what  he  had thought it was
Yeah, he said in a kind  of  relieved  sneer,  which  is  quite tricky,  well,  I  wouldn't  want  to  overtax your imagination, robot
For a while nobody said  anything,  and  Zaphod  realized
that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation, and that it was up to him
I can't help noticing that you have parked your ship,  he  said with  a  nod  of  one  of his heads in the appropriate direction, through mine
There was no denying this
Without regard for any kind of  proper dimensional  behaviour  they  had  simply materialized their ship
precisely where they wanted it to be, which  meant  that  it  was simply  locked  through the Heart of Gold as if they were nothing more than two combs
Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if  the conversation  would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of questions
haven't you
he added
Yes, replied the robot
Er, OK, said Zaphod
So what are you cats doing here
Silence
Robots, said Zaphod, what are you robots doing here
We have come, rasped the robot, for the Gold of the Bail
Zaphod nodded
He waggled his gun to invite further  elaboration
The robot seemed to understand this
The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek, continued the  robot, to release our Masters from Krikkit
Zaphod nodded again
He waggled his gun again
The Key, continued the robot simply, was disintegrated in time and space
The Golden Bail is embedded in the device which drives
your ship
It will be reconstituted in the Key
Our Masters shall be released
The Universal Readjustment will continue
Zaphod nodded again
What are you talking about
he said
A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot's  totally expressionless  face
He  seemed  to be finding the conversation
depressing
Obliteration, it said
We seek  the  Key,  it  repeated,  we already  have the Wooden Pillar, the Steel Pillar and the Perspex
Pillar
In a moment we will have the Gold Bail
No you won't
We will, stated the robot
No you won't
It makes my ship work
In a moment, repeated the robot patiently, we  will  have  the
Gold Bail
You will not, said Zaphod
And then we must go, said the robot, in all seriousness, to  a party
Oh, said Zaphod, startled
Can I come
No, said the robot
We are going to shoot you
Oh yeah
said Zaphod, waggling his gun
Yes, said the robot, and they shot him
Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him  again  before he fell down
Shhh, said Slartibartfast
Listen and watch
Night had now fallen on ancient Krikkit
The  sky  was  dark  and
empty
The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly  on  the  breeze
They  stood  beneath  a  tree  from which heady fragrances wafted around them
Arthur squatted and felt the Informational  Illusion
of  the  soil  and  the grass
He ran it through his fingers
The soil seemed heavy and rich, the grass  strong
It  was  hard  to
avoid  the impression that this was a thoroughly delightful place in all respects
The sky was, however, extremely blank and  seemed  to  Arthur  to cast  a  certain  chill  over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, landscape
Still, he supposed, it's a question of what
you're used to
He felt  a tap on his shoulder and looked up
Slartibartfast  was quietly  directing his attention to something down the other side
of the hill
He looked and  could  just  see  some  faint  lights dancing and waving, and moving slowly in their direction
As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the  dim lights  and  noises  resolved  themselves  into  a small group of people who were walking home across the hill towards the town
They walked quite near the watchers beneath  the  tree,  swinging lanterns  which  made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and grass, chattering contentedly, and actually  singing  a  song about  how terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how much they enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to be  going  home  to  see their wives and children, with a lilting chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling  particularly nice at this time of year and that it was a pity the dog had died seeing as it liked them so much
Arthur could almost imagine Paul
McCartney  sitting  with  his  feet  up  by  the fire on evening, humming it to Linda and wondering what to buy with the  proceeds, and thinking probably Essex
The Masters of Krikkit, breathed Slartibartfast  in  sepulchral tones
Coming, as it did, so hard upon the heels  of  his  own  thoughts about  Essex this remark caused Arthur a moment's confusion
Then
the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered  mind, and  he  discovered  that he still didn't understand what the old man meant
What
he said
The Masters of Krikkit, said Slartibartfast again, and  if  his breathing  had  been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like someone in Hades with bronchitis
Arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little information he had at his disposal at this point
The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because  they seemed  a  little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be white, but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant; a  little whimsical  perhaps, one wouldn't necessarily want to spend a long coach journey with them, but the point was that if they  deviated in any way from being good straightforward people it was in being perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough
So  why  all  this
rasping  lungwork  from  Slartibartfast  which  would  seem  more appropriate to a radio commercial for one of  those  nasty  films about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them
Then, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too
He  hadn't  quite fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket, and what
Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point  as if sensing what was going through his mind
The game you know as cricket, he  said,  and  his  voice  still seemed  to  be  wandering lost in subterranean passages, is just one of those curious freaks  of  racial  memory  which  can  keep images  alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time
Of all the races on  the  Galaxy,
only  the  English  could  possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform  it  into what I'm afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game
Rather fond of it myself, he added, but in most people's  eyes you  have  been  inadvertently  guilty  of the most grotesque bad taste
Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the
wicket, that's very nasty
Um, said Arthur with a reflective frown to  indicate  that  his
cognitive  synapses  were coping with this as best as they could, um
And  these,  said  Slartibartfast,  slipping  back  into  crypt guttural  and  indicating  the  group  of Krikkit men who had now walked past them, are the ones who started it all, and  it  will start tonight
Come, we will follow, and see why
They slipped out from  underneath  the  tree,  and  followed  the cheery party along the dark hill path
Their natural instinct was
to tread quietly and  stealthily  in  pursuit  of  their  quarry, though,   as   they   were  simply  walking  through  a  recorded Informational Illusion, they could as easily  have  been  wearing euphoniums  and  woad  for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them
Arthur noticed that a couple of members of  the  party  were  now singing  a  different  song
It came lilting back to them through
the soft night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad  which  would have netted McCartney Kent and Sussex and enabled him to put in a fair offer for Hampshire
You must surely know, said Slartibartfast to Ford, what it  is that is about to happen
Me
said Ford
No
Did you not learn Ancient  Galactic  History  when  you  were  a
child
I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod,  said  Ford,  it  was
very  distracting
Which  isn't  to say that I didn't learn some pretty stunning things
At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the  song  that the party were singing
The middle eight bridge, which would have
had  McCartney  firmly  consolidated  in  Winchester  and  gazing intently  over  the  Test  Valley to the rich pickings of the New Forest beyond,  had  some  curious  lyrics
The  songwriter  was
referring to meeting with a girl not under the moon or beneath the stars but above the grass, which struck  Arthur  a  little prosaic
Then  he  looked up again at the bewildering black sky,
and had the distinct feeling that there was  an  important  point here,  if  only he could grasp what it was
It gave him a feeling
of being alone in the Universe, and he said so
No, said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his  step, the  people  of Krikkit have never thought to themselves `We are alone in the Universe
They are surrounded by a huge Dust Cloud,
you  see,  their  single  sun with its single world, and they are right out on the utmost eastern edge of the  Galaxy
Because  of
the  Dust  Cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky
At night it is totally blank, During the day there  is  the  sun, but  you  can't  look  directly  at  that so they don't
They are
hardly aware of the sky
It's as if they had a blind  spot  which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon
You see, the reason why they have never thought `We are alone in the  Universe'  is  that  until tonight they don't know about the Universe
Until tonight
He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him
Imagine, he said, never even thinking `We  are  alone'  simply because  it  has  never occurred to you to think that there's any other way to be
He moved on again
I'm afraid this is going to be a little unnerving, he added
As he spoke, they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high up  in  the  sightless  sky  above  them
They glanced upwards in
alarm, but for a moment or two could see nothing
Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to so  with  it
They   were   glancing   around   themselves   in
consternation,  left,  right,  forwards,  backwards,  even at the ground
It never occurred to them to look upwards
The profoundness of the shock and  horror  they  emanated  a  few moments  later  when  the  burning  wreckage  of a spaceship came hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed  about  half  a mile  from where they were standing was something that you had to be there to experience
Some speak of the Heart of Gold in  hushed  tones,  some  of  the Starship Bistromath
Many speak of the legendary  and  gigantic  Starship  Titanic,  a majestic  and  luxurious  cruise-liner  launched  from  the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol some hundreds  of years ago now, and with good reason
It was  sensationally  beautiful,  staggeringly  huge,  and  more pleasantly  equipped than any ship in what now remains of history (see note below on the Campaign for Real Time)  but  it  had  the misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of Improbability Physics,  long  before  this  difficult  and  cussed  branch   of knowledge was fully, or at all, understood
The designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build a  prototype  Improbability  Field  into  it,  which  was  meant, supposedly, to ensure that  it  was  Infinitely  Improbable  that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship
They did not realize that because  of  the  quasi-reciprocal  and circular  nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that was Infinitely Improbable was  actually  very  likely  to  happen almost immediately
The Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty  sight  as  it  lay beached  like  a silver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laser- lit tracery of its construction gantries, a  brilliant  cloud  of pins   and   needles  of  light  against  the  deep  interstellar blackness; but when launched, it did not even manage to  complete its  very  first  radio  message  -  an SOS - before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total existence failure
However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure  of  one science  in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another
It was conclusively proven that more  people  watched  the  tri-d coverage  of  the  launch  than actually existed at the time, and this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever  in the science of audience research
Another spectacular media event of that time  was  the  supernova which  the  star Ysllodins underwent a few hours later
Ysllodins
is the star around which most of  the  Galaxy's  major  insurance underwriters live, or rather lived
But whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which  come  to mind,  such  as  the Galactic Fleet Battleships - the GSS Daring, the GSS Audacy and the GSS Suicidal Insanity - are all spoken  of with  awe,  pride,  enthusiasm,  affection,  admiration,  regret, jealousy, resentment, in fact most of the better known  emotions, the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was Krikkit One, the first spaceship ever  built  by  the  people  of Krikkit
This is not because it was a wonderful ship
It wasn't
It was a crazy piece of near junk
It looked as if  it  had  been knocked up in somebody's backyard, and this was in fact precisely
where it had been knocked up
The  astonishing  thing  about  the ship  was  not  that  it was one well (it wasn't) but that it was
done at all
The period of time which  had  elapsed  between  the moment  that  the people of Krikkit had discovered that there was
such a thing as space and the launching of their first  spaceship was almost exactly a year
Ford Prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped  himself  in, that  this  was  just another Informational Illusion, and that he was therefore completely safe
In real life it wasn't a  ship  he
would have set foot in for all the rice wine in China
Extremely rickety was one phrase which sprang to mind, and Please  may  I
get out
was another
This is going to fly
said Arthur, giving gaunt looks,  at  the lashed-together  pipework  and wiring which festooned the cramped
interior of the ship
Slartibartfast  assured  him  that  it  would,  that  they   were perfectly  safe  and  that  it  was  all  going  to  be extremely instructive and not a little harrowing
Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed
Why not, said Ford, go mad
In front of  them  and,  of  course,  totally  unaware  of  their
presence  for  the  very  good  reason that they weren't actually there, were the three pilots
They had also constructed the ship
They  had  been  on  the  hill  path that night singing wholesome heartwarming songs
Their brains had been very slightly turned by
the  nearby  crash  of  the alien spaceship
They had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage  of  that
burnt-up  spaceship,  all  the  while  singing lilting spaceship- stripping ditties
They had then built their own  ship  and  this
was  it
This  was their ship, and they were currently singing a little  song  about  that  too,  expressing  the  twin  joys   of
achievement  and ownership
The chorus was a little poignant, and told of their sorrow that their work  had  kept  them  such  long
hours  in  the  garage,  away from the company of their wives and children, who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful by  bringing  them  continual stories of how nicely the puppy was growing up
Pow, they took off
They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what  it was doing
No way, said Ford a while later after they had  recovered  from the  shock  of  acceleration,  and  were  climbing  up out of the planet's atmosphere, no way, he repeated, does  anyone  design and  build a ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated
I
don't believe it
Prove it to me and I still won't  believe  it
He  shook  his  head thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at
the nothingness outside it
The trip passed uneventfully  for  a  while,  and  Slartibartfast fastwound them through it
Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner  perimeter  of the  hollow,  spherical Dust Cloud which surrounded their sun and home planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out
It was more as if there was a gradual change in the  texture  and consistency of space
The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple
past them
It was a very cold darkness, a very  blank  and  heavy darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit
The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a  slow  grip on  Arthur's  heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the Krikkit pilots which hung in the  air  like  a  thick  static charge
They  were  now  on  the very boundary of the historical
knowledge of their race
This was the  very  limit  beyond  which none  of  them  had ever speculated, or even known that there was
any speculation to be done
The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship
Inside  was  the silence  of  history
Their  historic mission was to find out if
there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from which the wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe, strange and incomprehensible  though  this  thought  was  to  the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit
History was gathering itself to deliver another blow
Still  the  darkness  thrummed  at  them,  the  blank   enclosing darkness
It  seemed  closer  and  closer,  thicker and thicker,
heavier and heavier
And suddenly it was gone
They flew out of the cloud
They saw the staggering jewels of the  night  in  their  infinite dust and their minds sang with fear
For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep  of the  Galaxy,  itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe
And then they turned round
It'll have to go, the men of Krikkit said as they  headed  back for home
On the way back they sang a  number  of  tuneful  and  reflective songs  on  the  subjects  of  peace,  justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms
So  you  see,  said   Slartibartfast,   slowly   stirring   his artificially  constructed  coffee,  and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers, between the interactive perceptions of mind and Universe, and thus generating the restructured matrices  of  implicitly  enfolded  subjectivity which  allowed  his  ship to reshape the very concept of time and space, how it is
Yes, said Arthur
Yes, said Ford
What do I do, said Arthur, with this piece of chicken
Slartibartfast glanced at him gravely
Toy with it, he said, toy with it
He demonstrated with his own piece
Arthur did so, and felt  the  slight  tingle  of  a  mathematical function  thrilling  through  the  chicken  leg as it moved four- dimensionally through what Slartibartfast  had  assured  him  was five-dimensional space
Overnight,  said  Slartibartfast,  the  whole  population   of Krikkit   was   transformed   from  being  charming,  delightful, intelligent
if whimsical
interpolated Arthur
ordinary  people,  said  Slartibartfast,  into  charming, delightful, intelligent
whimsical
manic xenophobes
The idea of a  Universe  didn't  fit  into
their  world picture, so to speak
They simply couldn't cope with it
And so, charmingly, delightfully, intelligently,  whimsically
if you like, they decided to destroy it
What's the matter now
I don't like the wine very much, said Arthur sniffing it
Well, send it back
It's all part of the mathematics of it
Arthur did so
He didn't like  the  topography  of  the  waiter's
smile, but he'd never liked graphs anyway
Where are we going
said Ford
Back   to   the   Room   of   Informational   Illusions,   said Slartibartfast,   rising   and   patting   his   mouth  with  the mathematical representation of a paper napkin,  for  the  second half
The people of Krikkit,  said  His  High  Judgmental  Supremacy, Judiciary  Pag,  LIVR  (the  Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed) Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes  Trial, are,  well,  you  know, they're just a bunch of real sweet guys, you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody
Hell, I feel
the same way some mornings
Shit
OK, he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of  him  and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his Ceremonial Beach Loafers, so you  wouldn't  necessarily  want  to  share  a Galaxy with these guys
This was true
The Krikkit attack on the Galaxy had been stunning
Thousands and thousands  of  huge  Krikkit  warships  had leapt suddenly out of
hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major  worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next wave, and  then  calmly  zapping  those  worlds  out  of existence
The Galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and prosperity  at  the  time,  reeled like a man getting mugged in a meadow
I mean, continued Judiciary Pag, gazing round the  ultra-modern (this  was  ten billion years ago, when ultra-modern meant lots of stainless steel and  brushed  concrete)  and  huge  courtroom, these guys are just obsessed
This too was true, and is the only  explanation  anyone  has  yet managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of Krikkit had pursued their new and  absolute  purpose  - the destruction of everything that wasn't Krikkit
It is also the only  explanation  for  their  bewildering  sudden grasp  of  all  the  hypertechnology  involved  in building their thousands of spaceships,  and  their  millions  of  lethal  white robots
These had really struck terror into the hearts  of  everyone  who had  encountered  them  -  in most cases, however, the terror was extremely short-lived, as was the person experiencing the terror
They  were  savage,  single-minded  flying  battle machines
They wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs which,  brandished
one  way, would knock down buildings and, brandished another way, fired blistering Omni-Destructo Zap Rays and, brandished a  third way,  launched  a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor incendiary devices  to  Maxi-Slorta  Hypernuclear  Devices  which could take out a major sun
Simply striking the grenades with the
battleclubs simultaneously primed them, and  launched  them  with phenomenal  accuracy  over  distances  ranging from mere yards to hundreds of thousands of miles
OK, said Judiciary Pag again, so we won
He paused and chewed a  little  gum
We won, he repeated, but that's no big deal
I
mean a medium-sized galaxy against one little world, and how long did it take us
Clerk of the Court
M'lud
said the severe little man in black, rising
How long, kiddo
It is a trifle difficult, m'lud, to be precise in  this  matter
Time and distance
Relax, guy, be vague
I hardly like to be vague, m'lud, over such a
Bite the bullet and be it
The Clerk of the Court blinked at him
It  was  clear  that  like most  of the Galactic legal profession he found Judiciary Pag (or
Zipo Bibrok 5 / 108, as his private name was known, inexplicably, to  be) a rather distressing figure
He was clearly a bounder and
a cad
He seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor of  the  finest  legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to
behave exactly as he liked, and unfortunately he appeared  to  be right
Er, well, m'lud, very approximately, two  thousand  years,  the Clerk murmured unhappily
And how many guys zilched out
Two grillion, m'lud
The Clerk sat down
A  hydrospectic  photo
of  him  at  this  point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly
Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein  were assembled  hundreds  of  the very highest officials of the entire Galactic administration, all  in  their  ceremonial  uniforms  or bodies,  depending  on  metabolism  and  custom
Behind a wall of
Zap-Proof Crystal stood a representative group of the  people  of Krikkit,  looking  with  calm,  polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgment on them
This was  the  most  momentous
occasion in legal history, and Judiciary Pag knew it
He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair
That's a whole lotta stiffs, he said quietly
The grim silence in the courtroom  seemed  in  accord  with  this view
So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you wouldn't  want  to  share a Galaxy with them, not if they're just gonna keep at it, not if they're  not  gonna  learn  to  relax  a little
I  mean it's just gonna be continual nervous time, isn't
it, right
Pow, pow, pow,  when  are  they  next  coming  at  us
Peaceful  coexistence is just right out, right
Get me some water somebody, thank you
He sat back and sipped reflectively
OK, he said, hear me, hear me
It's,  like,  these  guys,  you know,  are  entitled  to  their  own  view  of  the Universe
And
according to their view,  which  the  Universe  forced  on  them, right,  they  did  right
Sounds crazy, but I think you'll agree
They believe in
He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the  back  pocket
of his Judicial jeans
They believe  in  `peace,  justice,  morality,  culture,  sport, family life, and the obliteration of all other life forms'
He shrugged
I've heard a lot worse, he said
He scratched his crotch reflectively
Freeeow, he said
He took another sip of water, then held it up to the light and frowned at it
He twisted it round
Hey, is there something in this water
he said
Er, no, m'lud, said the Court Usher who had brought it to  him, rather nervously
Then take it away, snapped Judiciary Pag, and put something in it
I got an idea
He pushed away the glass and leaned forward
Hear me, hear me, he said
The solution was brilliant, and went like this: The planet of Krikkit was to be enclosed  for  perpetuity  in  an envelope  of  Slo-Time,  inside  which life would continue almost infinitely  slowly
All  light  would  be  deflected  round  the
envelope  so  that  it  would  remain invisible and impenetrable
Escape from the envelope would be utterly  impossible  unless  it were locked from the outside
When the rest of the Universe came to its  final  end,  when  the whole  of  creation  reached  its  dying  fall  (this was all, of course, in the days before it was  known  that  the  end  of  the Universe  would  be  a spectacular catering venture) and life and matter ceased to exist, then the planet of Krikkit  and  its  sun would  emerge  from its Slo-Time envelope and continue a solitary existence, such as it craved, in the twilight  of  the  Universal void
The Lock would be on an asteroid which  would  slowly  orbit  the envelope
The key would be the symbol of the Galaxy - the Wikkit Gate
By the time the applause in the court had  died  down,  Judiciary Pag was already in the Sens-O-Shower with a rather nice member of the jury that he'd slipped a note to half an hour earlier
Two months later, Zipo Bibrok 5 / 108 had cut the bottoms off his Galactic  State  jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee his judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having  Essence of  Qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of  the  jury
She  was  a  Soolfinian  girl  from  beyond   the
Cloudworlds  of  Yaga
She had skin like lemon silk and was very interested in legal bodies
Did you hear the news
she said
Weeeeelaaaaah
said Zipo Bibrok 5 / 108, and you would have had to have been there to know exactly why he said this
None of this
was on the tape of Informational Illusions, and is all  based  on hearsay
No,  he  added,  when  the  thing  that  had   made   him   say Weeeeelaaaaah  had  stopped  happening
He moved his body round
slightly to catch the first rays of the  third  and  greatest  of primeval  Vod's  three  suns  which  was  now  creeping  over the ludicrously beautiful horizon, and the  sky  now  glittered  with some of the greatest tanning power ever known
A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea,  trailed  along the  beach,  and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go next
On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again
It  drifted
back to sea
I hope it isn't good news, muttered Zipo Bibrok 5 / 108,  'cos I don't think I could bear it
Your Krikkit judgment was carried  out  today,  said  the  girl sumptuously
There  was  no  need  to say such a straightforward
thing sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it  anyway  because it  was  that  sort  of day
I heard it on the radio, she said,
when I went back to the ship for the oil
Uhuh, muttered Zipo and rested his head back  on  the  jewelled
sand
Something happened, she said
Mmmm
Just after the Slo-Time envelope  was  locked,  she  said,  and
paused  a  moment  from  rubbing  in the Essence of Qualactin, a Krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed  turned out  to be just missing after all
It appeared and tried to seize
the Key
Zipo sat up sharply
Hey, what
he said
it's all right, she said in a voice which would have calmed the Big  Bang down
Apparently there was a short battle
The Key and
the warship were disintegrated and blasted  into  the  space-time continuum
Apparently they are lost for ever
She smiled, and ran a little more Essence of Qualactin on to  her fingertips
He relaxed and lay back down
Do what you did a moment or two ago, he murmured
That
she said
No, no, he said, that
She tried again
That
she asked
Weeeeelaaaaah
Again, you had to be there
The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again
A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him
Nothing  is  lost  for  ever,  said  Slartibartfast,  his  face flickering  redly  in  the  light  of  the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take away,  except  for  the  Cathedral  of Chalesm
The what
said Arthur with a start
The Cathedral of  Chalesm,  repeated  Slartibartfast
It  was during  the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time
that I
The what
said Arthur again
The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what  he  hoped would  be one last onslaught on his story
The robot waiter moved
through the space-time matrices  in  a  way  which  spectacularly combined  the  surly  with  the obsequious, made a snatch for the candle and got it
They had had the bill, had argued convincingly
about  who  had  had  the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine they had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly  aware,  had  thereby successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into a parking orbit round  a  strange  planet
The  waiter  was  now
anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro
All will become clear, said Slartibartfast
When
In a minute
Listen
The time streams  are  now  very  polluted
There's a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and more and more of  it  is  now  being  regurgitated  into  the physical world
Eddies in the space-time continuum, you see
So I hear, said Arthur
Look, where are we going
said Ford,  pushing  his  chair  back from the table with impatience
Because I'm eager to get there
We are going, said Slartibartfast in a  slow,  measured  voice, to  try  to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the whole of the Key they need to unlock the planet of  Krikkit  from the  Slo-Time  envelope  and  release  the rest of their army and their mad Masters
It's just, said Ford, that you mentioned a party
I did, said Slartibartfast, and hung his head
He realized that it had been a mistake, because the  idea  seemed to  exercise  a  strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of Ford Prefect
The more that Slartibartfast  unravelled  the  dark
and tragic story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls
The old man felt that he should  not  have  mentioned  the  party until  he  absolutely had to
But there it was, the fact was out,
and Ford Prefect had attached himself to it the way  an  Arcturan Megaleach  attaches  itself  to its victim before biting his head off and making off with his spaceship
When, said Ford eagerly, do we get there
When I've finished telling you why we have to go there
I know why I'm going, said Ford, and leaned back, sticking  his hands  behind  his  head
He  gave  one of his smiles which made
people twitch
Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement
He  had  been  planning  to  learn  to  play   the   octraventral heebiephone  -  a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had the wrong number of mouths
He had also been planning to write an eccentric and  relentlessly inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order to set the record wrong about  one  or  two  matters  he  saw  as important
Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part-time work for  the  Campaign  for  Real Time and had started to take it all seriously for the first time in his life
As  a  result  he  now
found  himself  spending  his fast-declining years combating evil and trying to save the Galaxy
He found it exhausting work and sighed heavily
Listen, he said, at Camtim
What
said Arthur
The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later
I noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent
times plopped back into existence seemed  to  correspond  to  the five  pieces of the missing Key
Only two I could trace exactly -
the Wooden Pillar, which appeared on your planet, and the  Silver Bail
It  seems to be at some sort of party
We must go there to
retrieve it before the Krikkit robots find it, or who knows  what may hap
No, said Ford firmly
We must go to  the  party  in  order  to drink a lot and dance with girls
But haven't you understood everything I
Yes, said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness,  I've
understood  it  all  perfectly well
That's why I want to have as many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while  there
are still any left
If everything you've shown us is true
True
Of course it's true
then we don't stand a whelk's chance in a supernova
A what
said Arthur sharply again
He had  been  following  the
conversation  doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose the thread now
A whelk's chance in a supernova, repeated Ford  without  losing momentum
The
What's a whelk got to do with a supernova
said Arthur
It doesn't, said Ford levelly, stand a chance in one
He paused to see if the matter was now cleared  up
The  freshly
puzzled  looks  clambering  across Arthur's face told him that it wasn't
A supernova, said Ford as quickly and as clearly as  he  could, is  a  star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as a  super-heavy  neutron  star
It's  a star which burns up other
stars, got it
Nothing stands a chance in a supernova
I see, said Arthur
The
So why a whelk particularly
Why not a whelk
Doesn't matter
Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking  up  his  early
fierce momentum as best he could
The  point  is,  he  said,  that  people  like  you  and   me, Slartibartfast, and Arthur - particularly and especially Arthur - are just dilletantes, eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds  if  you like
Slartibartfast  frowned,  partly  in  puzzlement  and  partly  in umbrage
He started to speak

is as far as he got
We're not obsessed by anything, you see, insisted Ford
And that's the deciding factor
We can't win against  obsession
They care, we don't
They win
I care about lots of things,  said  Slartibartfast,  his  voice
trembling   partly   with   annoyance,   but   partly  also  with uncertainty
Such as
Well, said  the  old  man,  life,  the  Universe
Everything,
really
Fjords
Would you die for them
Fjords
blinked Slartibartfast in surprise
No
Well then
Wouldn't see the point, to be honest
And I still  can't  see  the  connection,  said  Arthur,  with
whelks
Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and
refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point
The point is, he hissed, that we are not obsessive people, and we don't stand a chance against
Except for your sudden obsession with whelks,  pursued  Arthur, which I still haven't understood
Will you please leave whelks out of it
I will if you will, said Arthur
You brought the subject up
It was an error, said Ford, forget them
The point is this
He leant forward and rested his  forehead  on  the  tips  of  his
fingers
What was I talking about
he said wearily
Let's just go down to  the  party,  said  Slartibartfast,  for whatever reason
He stood up, shaking his head
I think that's what I was trying to say, said Ford
For some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles  were  in  the bathroom
Time travel is increasingly regarded  as  a  menace
History  is being polluted
The Encyclopedia Galactica has much to  say  on  the  theory  and practice  of  time  travel,  most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics,  and  since it was impossible to do this before time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of  confusion as  to  how  the  idea  was  arrived  at  in the first place
One
rationalization of this problem states that time travel  was,  by its  very  nature,  discovered  simultaneously  at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk
The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well
Here is an example
It may not seem to be  an  important  one  to some  people,  but  to  others  it  is  crucial
It is certainly
significant in that it was the  single  event  which  caused  the Campaign  for Real Time to be set up in the first place (or is it last
It depends which way round you see  history  as  happening,
and this too is now an increasingly vexed question)
There is, or was, a poet
His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what are  widely  regarded  throughout  the Galaxy as being the finest
poems in existence, the Songs of the Long Land
They are/were unspeakably wonderful
That is to say, you couldn't speak  very  much  of them at once without being so overcome with
emotion, truth and a sense of wholeness  and  oneness  of  things that  you wouldn't pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block, possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a  quick  glass  of perspective and soda
They were that good
Lallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands  of  Effa
He lived there, and he wrote his poems there
He wrote them on pages
made of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of  education  or correcting fluid
He wrote about the light in the forest and what
he thought about that
He wrote about the darkness in the forest, and  what  he thought about that
He wrote about the girl who had
left him and precisely what he thought about that
Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over
News of   them  spread  like  morning  sunlight
For  centuries  they
illuminated and watered the lives  of  many  people  whose  lives might otherwise have been darker and drier
Then, shortly after the invention  of  time  travel,  some  major correcting  fluid  manufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he had had access to some  high-quality correcting  fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few words on that effect
They travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the situation  -  with  some  difficulty  -  to  him,  and did indeed persuade him
In fact they persuaded him to such an  effect  that
he  became extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom he was otherwise destined to write which such precision never got around  to  leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest to a rather nice pad in town and he frequently  commuted  to  the future to do chat shows, on which he sparkled wittily
He never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was  a problem,   but   an  easily  solved  one
The  manufacturers  of
correcting fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere  with a  copy of a later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate  mistake and correction on the way
Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless
Others argue  that  they  are  exactly  the same as they always were, so
what's changed
The first people say that that isn't  the  point
They aren't quite sure what the point is, but they are quite sure that that isn't it
They set up the Campaign for Real Time to try
to  stop this sort of thing going on
Their case was considerably strengthened  by  the  fact  that  a  week  after  they  had  set
themselves  up,  news broke that not only had the great Cathedral of Chalesm been pulled down in order to build a new ion refinery, but  that the construction of the refinery had taken so long, and had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow ion production  to  start  on time, that the Cathedral of Chalesm had now never been built in the first place
Picture postcards of the
cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable
So a lot of history is now gone for ever
The Campaign  for  Real Timers  claim  that  just  as  easy travel eroded the differences
between one country  and  another,  and  between  one  world  and another,  so  time  travel is now eroding the differences between one age and another
The past, they say, is now truly  like  a
foreign country
They do things exactly the same there
Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering
about  and  clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which he still indulged himself  in  whenever  he  made  any  of  these hateful  and  painful materializations that he was determined not to let himself get used to
He looked around for the others
They weren't there
He looked around for the others again
They still weren't there
He closed his eyes
He opened them He looked around for the others
They obstinately persisted in their absence
He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making  this  completely futile  exercise  once more, and because it was only then, whilst his eyes were closed, that his brain began to register  what  his eyes  had  been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown crept across his face
So he opened his eyes again to check  his  facts  and  the  frown stayed put
If anything, it intensified, and got a good firm  grip
If  this was  a  party  it  was  a  very  bad  one,  so bad, in fact, that
everybody else had left
He abandoned this  line  of  thought  as futile
Obviously  this  wasn't  a  party
It  was a cave, or a
labyrinth, or a tunnel of  something  -  there  was  insufficient light  to tell
All was darkness, a damp shiny darkness
The only
sounds were the  echoes  of  his  own  breathing,  which  sounded worried
He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to the
thin ghostly echo of his  cough  trailing  away  amongst  winding corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as  if to say
Yes
This happened to every slightest noise he made, and  it  unnerved him
He  tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned
to him it was a hollow dirge and he stopped
His mind  was  suddenly  full  of  images  from  the  story  that Slartibartfast had been telling him
He half-expected suddenly to
see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows  and  kill him
He  caught  his breath
They didn't
He let it go again
He
didn't know what he did expect
Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at that  moment  there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign
It said, silently: You have been Diverted The sign flicked off again, in a way which Arthur was not at  all certain  he  liked
It  flicked  off with a sort of contemptuous
flourish
Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was  just a  ridiculous  trick of his imagination
A neon sign is either on
or off, depending on whether it has electricity  running  through it  or  not
There  was  no  way, he told himself, that it could
possibly effect the transition from one state to the other with a contemptuous  flourish
He hugged himself tightly in his dressing
gown and shivered, nevertheless
The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up, bafflingly, with just three dots and a comma
Like this:
Only in green neon
It was trying, Arthur realized after staring at this  perplexedly for  a  second  or  two, to indicate that there was more to come, that the sentence was not complete
Trying with almost superhuman
pedantry, he reflected
Or at least, inhuman pedantry
The sentence then completed itself with these two words: Arthur Dent
He reeled
He steadied himself to have another clear look at  it
It still said Arthur Dent, so he reeled again
Once again, the sign flicked off, and left him  blinking  in  the darkness  with  just the dim red image of his name jumping on his retina
Welcome, the sign now suddenly said
After a moment, it added: I Don't Think
The stone-cold fear which had been hovering about Arthur all this time,  waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now come and pounced on him
He tried to fight  it  off
He  dropped
into  a kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television, but it must have been someone with stronger knees
He
peered huntedly into the darkness
Er, hello
he said
He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and  without the  er
At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly
as if somebody started to beat on a bass drum
He listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just his heart beating
He listened for a few seconds more and realized  that  it  wasn't his heart beating, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass drum
Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves,  and  leapt off
He  put a hand out on the floor to steady his alert crouch,
which wasn't holding up very well
The sign changed itself again
It said: Do Not be Alarmed
After a pause, it added: Be Very Very Frightened, Arthur Dent
Once again it flicked off
Once again it left  him  in  darkness
His  eyes seemed to be popping out of his head
He wasn't certain if this was because they were trying to see more clearly,  or  if
they simply wanted to leave at this point
Hello
he said again, this time trying to put a note of  rugged and aggressive self-assertion into it
Is anyone there
There was no reply, nothing
This unnerved Arthur Dent even more than a reply would have done, and  he  began  to  back away from the scary nothingness
And the
more he backed away, the more scared he became
After a while  he realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he
had seen in which the hero backs further and  further  away  from some imagined terror in front of him, only to bump into it coming up from behind
Just then it suddenly  occurred  to  him  to  turn  round  rather quickly
There was nothing there
Just blackness
This really unnerved him, and he started to back away from  that, back the way he had come
After doing this for a short while it suddenly  occurred  to  him that  he  was  now  backing  towards  whatever it was he had been backing away from in the first place
This, he couldn't help thinking, must be a foolish thing  to  do
He  decided  he  would be better off backing the way he had first been backing, and turned around again
It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been  the correct  one,  because there was an indescribably hideous monster standing quietly behind him
Arthur  yawed  wildly  as  his  skin
tried  to  jump  one  way  and his skeleton the other, whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of
Bet you weren't expecting to see me again,  said  the  monster, which  Arthur  couldn't help thinking was a strange remark for it to make, seeing as he had never met the creature before
He could
tell  that he hadn't met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights
It was
it was
it was
Arthur blinked at it
It stood very still
It did look  a  little familiar
A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized  that  what  he was looking at was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly
He wondered why anybody would  be  showing  him  a  six-foot-high hologram  of  a housefly at this time
He wondered whose voice he
had heard
It was a terribly realistic hologram
It vanished
Or perhaps you remember me better, said the voice suddenly, and it  was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten tar glurping out of a  drum  with  evil  on  its  mind,  as  the rabbit
With a sudden ping,  there  was  a  rabbit  there  in  the  black labyrinth  with  him,  a  huge,  monstrously,  hideously soft and lovable rabbit - an image again, but one on  which  every  single soft and lovable hair seemed like a real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat
Arthur was startled to see his  own
reflection  in its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge brown eyes
Born in darkness, rumbled the voice, raised in  darkness
One morning  I  poked  my head for the first time into the bright new
world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously  like  some primitive instrument made of flint
Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you
Rather hard  as  I recall
You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in
I  happen  to  know that because in my next life I came back as a fly again and you swatted me
Again
Only this time  you  swatted
me with the bag you'd made of my previous skin
Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless  man,  you are also staggeringly tactless
The voice paused whilst Arthur gawped
I see you have lost the bag,  said  the  voice
Probably  got bored with it, did you
Arthur shook his head helplessly
He wanted to  explain  that  he had  been  in  fact  very fond of the bag and had looked after it
very well and had taken it with him wherever he  went,  but  that somehow  every  time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with the wrong bag and that, curiously enough, even  as they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at the moment appeared  to  be  made  out  of rather nasty fake leopard skin, and wasn't the one he'd had a few moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was,  and wasn't  one  he  would  have  chosen himself and heaven knew what would be in it as it wasn't his, and he would  much  rather  have his  original  bag  back,  except  that he was of course terribly sorry for having  so  peremptorily  removed  it,  or  rather  its component  parts,  i
e
the rabbit skin, from its previous owner,
viz
the rabbit whom he currently had the  honour  of  attempting vainly to address
All he actually managed to say was Erp
Meet the newt you trod on, said the voice
And there was, standing in the  corridor  with  Arthur,  a  giant green  scaly  newt
Arthur  turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and
found himself standing in the middle of  the  rabbit
He  yelped again, but could find nowhere to leap to
That was me, too, continued the voice in a low menacing rumble, as if you didn't know
Know
said Arthur with a start
Know
The interesting thing about reincarnation,  rasped  the  voice,
is  that  most  people,  most  spirits, are not aware that it is happening to them
He paused for effect
As far as Arthur was  concerned  there  was already quite enough effect going on
I was aware, hissed  the  voice,  that  is,  I  became  aware
Slowly
Gradually
He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath
I could hardly help it, could I
he bellowed,  when  the  same thing  kept happening, over and over and over again
Every life I
ever lived, I got killed by Arthur Dent
Any world, any body, any time,  I'm  just  getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent -
pow, he kills me
Hard not to notice
Bit of a memory jogger
Bit  of  a  pointer
Bit of a bloody giveaway
That's funny,' my spirit would say to itself as it  winged  its way  back  to  the netherworld after another fruitless Dent-ended venture into the land of the living, `that man who just ran  over me as I was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a little familiar
And gradually I got to  piece  it  together,
Dent, you multiple-me-murderer
The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors
Arthur
stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief
Here's the moment, Dent, shrieked the  voice,  now  reaching  a feverish  pitch  of  hatred,  here's  the  moment when at last I knew
It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly  opened  up in  front  of Arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but here's an attempt at a description of how hideous it was
It  was
a huge palpitating wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale-like creature rolling around  it  and  sliding  over  monstrous  white tombstones
High  above the cave rose a vast promontory in which
could be seen the dark recesses of  two  further  fearful  caves, which
Arthur Dent suddenly realized that he  was  looking  at  his  own mouth,  when  his  attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it
He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes
When he looked again  the  appalling  apparition  had  gone
The corridor  was  dark  and,  briefly, silent
He was alone with his
thoughts
They  were  extremely  unpleasant  thoughts  and  would rather have had a chaperone
The next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of  a  large section  of wall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just dark blackness behind it
Arthur looked into it in much the  same
way that a mouse looks into a dark dog-kennel
And the voice spoke to him again
Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent, it said
I  dare  you  to tell me it was a coincidence
It was a coincidence, said Arthur quickly
It was not
came the answering bellow
It was, said Arthur, it was
If it was a coincidence, then my name, roared  the  voice,  is
not Agrajag
And presumably, said Arthur, you would  claim  that  that  was
your name
Yes
hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather  deft
syllogism
Well, I'm afraid it was still a coincidence, said Arthur
Come in here and say that
howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy again
Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least, he  nearly said that it was a coincidence
His tongue rather lost
its footing towards the end of the last word because  the  lights came up and revealed what it was he had walked into
It was a Cathedral of Hate
It was the product of a mind that was  not  merely  twisted,  but actually sprained
It was huge
It was horrific
It had a Statue in it
We will come to the Statue in a moment
The vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had  been carved  out  of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was that that was precisely what it had been carved  out  of
It
seemed  to  Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it
It was black
Where it wasn't black you were inclined  to  wish  that  it  was, because  the  colours  with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly  across  the  whole  spectrum  of eye-defying  colours  from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow,  Burnt  hombre  and Gan Green on the way
The unspeakable details  which  these  colours  picked  out  were gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch
The gargoyles  all  looked  inwards  from  the  walls,  from  the pillars,  from  the  flying  buttresses,  from  the choir stalls, towards the Statue, to which we will come in a moment
And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his  lunch, then it was clear from the gargoyles' faces that the Statue would have put them off theirs, had they been alive to  eat  it,  which they  weren't,  and  had  anybody tried to serve them some, which they wouldn't
Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone  tablets  in memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent
The names of some of those commemorated were underlined  and  had asterisks against them
So, for instance, the name of a cow which
had been slaughtered and of which Arthur Dent had happened to eat a  fillet  steak  would  have the plainest engraving, whereas the name of a fish which Arthur had himself caught and  then  decided he  didn't  like  and  left on the side of the plate had a double underlining, three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger  added as decoration, just to make the point
And what was most disturbing  about  all  this,  apart  from  the Statue,  to  which we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear implication that all these people and creatures were  indeed  the same person, over and over again
And it was equally clear that this person was, however  unfairly, extremely upset and annoyed
In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached  a  level  of annoyance  the like of which had never been seen in the Universe
It was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning searing  flame of  annoyance,  an  annoyance which now spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage
And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression  in  the Statue  in the centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue of Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one
Fifty feet  tall  if  it
was  an  inch,  there  was not an inch of it which wasn't crammed with insult to its subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of thing  would  be  enough  to  make any subject feel bad
From the
small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish  cut  of  his dressing  gown,  there  was no aspect of Arthur Dent which wasn't lambasted and vilified by the sculptor
Arthur appeared as  a  gorgon,  an  evil,  rapacious,  ravenning, bloodied  ogre,  slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man Universe
With each of the thirty arms which  the  sculptor  in  a  fit  of artistic  fervour had decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea  out of  his  hair,  or  doing something which Arthur at first looking couldn't quite identify
His many feet were mostly stamping on ants
Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head  and  shook  it slowly  from  side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things
And when he opened his eyes again, there in front  of  him  stood the  figure  of  the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had supposedly been persecuting all this time
HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH
said Agrajag
He, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad  fat  bat
He  waddled slowly around Arthur, and poked at him with bent claws
Look
protested Arthur
HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH
explained  Agrajag,   and   Arthur reluctantly  accepted  this  on  the  grounds  that he was rather
frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition
Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery
His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken floundering things they were that if they had been strong, muscular beaters of the air
The frightening thing  was  probably
the  tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical odds
He had the most astounding collection of teeth
They looked as if they each  came  from  a  completely  different animal,  and  they  were  ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew  anything he'd  lacerate  half his own face along with it, and possibly put an eye out as well
Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about  as sane as a fish in a privet bush
I was at a cricket match, he rasped
This seemed on the face of it such  a  preposterous  notion  that Arthur practically choked
Not in this body, screeched the creature, not  in  this  body
This  is  my last body
My last life
This is my revenge body
My kill-Arthur-Dent body
My last chance
I had to fight to get  it,
too
But
I was at, roared Agrajag, a cricket match
I had a weak  heart condition,  but  what,  I  said to my wife, can happen to me at a
cricket match
As I'm watching, what happens
Two people quite maliciously appear out  of  thin  air  just  in front  of  me
The  last thing I can't help but notice before my
poor heart gives out in shock is that one of them is Arthur  Dent wearing a rabbit bone in his beard
Coincidence
Yes, said Arthur
Coincidence
screamed the  creature,  painfully  thrashing  its broken  wings, and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a
particularly nasty tooth
On closer  examination,  such  as  he'd been  hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much of Agrajag's face
was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters
He backed away nervously
He tugged at his beard
He was appalled to  discover  that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it
He
pulled it out and threw it away
Look, he said, it's just fate playing silly buggers with  you
With me
With us
It's a complete coincidence
What have you got  against  me,  Dent
snarled  the  creature,
advancing on him in a painful waddle
Nothing, insisted Arthur, honestly, nothing
Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare
Seems a strange way to relate to  somebody  you've  got  nothing against,  killing them all the time
Very curious piece of social
interaction, I would call that
I'd also call it a lie
But look, said Arthur, I'm very sorry
There's been a terrible
misunderstanding
I've got to go
Have you got a clock
I'm meant to be helping save the Universe
He backed away still further
Agrajag advanced still further
At one point, he hissed, at one point, I decided to  give  up
Yes,  I would not come back
I would stay in the netherworld
And what happened
Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that  he  had  no idea  and  didn't want to have one either
He found he had backed
up against the cold dark stone that had been carved by  who  knew what  Herculean  effort  into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers
He glanced up at his own  horrendously  parodied  image
towering  above  him
He was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was meant to be doing
I got  yanked  involuntarily  back  into  the  physical  world, pursued  Agrajag,  as  a  bunch  of petunias
In, I might add, a
bowl
This particularly happy little lifetime  started  off  with me,  in  my  bowl,  unsupported,  three  hundred  miles above the
surface of a particularly grim planet
Not  a  naturally  tenable position  for  a  bowl of petunias, you might think
And you'd be
right
That life ended a very short while  later,  three  hundred miles  lower
In, I might add, the fresh wreckage of a whale
My
spirit brother
He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred
On the way down,  he  snarled,  I  couldn't  help  noticing  a flashy-looking white spaceship
And looking out of a port on this
flashy-looking  spaceship  was  a   smug-looking   Arthur   Dent
Coincidence
Yes
yelped Arthur
He glanced up again, and realized that  the
arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence a bowl of doomed petunias
This was not a concept which
leapt easily to the eye
I must go, insisted Arthur
You may go, said Agrajag, after I have killed you
No, that won't be any use, explained Arthur, beginning to climb
up  the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, because I have to save the Universe, you see
I have  to  find  a  Silver  Bail,
that's the point
Tricky thing to do dead
Save the Universe
spat Agrajag with contempt
You should have
thought of that before you started your vendetta against me
What about the time you were on Stavromula Beta and someone
I've never been there, said Arthur
tried to assassinate you and you ducked
Who  do  you  think the bullet hit
What did you say
Never been there, repeated Arthur
What are you talking about
I have to go
Agrajag stopped in his tracks
You must have been there
You  were  responsible  for  my  death there, as everywhere else
An innocent bystander
He quivered
I've never heard of the place, insisted Arthur
I've certainly never had anyone try to assassinate me
Other than you
Perhaps I
go there later, do you think
Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror
You haven't been to Stavromula Beta
yet
he whispered
No, said Arthur,  I  don't  know  anything  about  the  place
Certainly never been to it, and don't have any plans to go
Oh, you go there all right, muttered Agrajag in a broken voice,
you go there all right
Oh zark
he tottered, and stared wildly about him at his huge Cathedral of Hate
I've brought  you  here
too soon
He started to scream and  bellow
I've  brought  you  here  too
zarking soon
Suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur
I'm going to kill you  anyway
he  roared
Even  if  it's  a logical impossibility I'm going to zarking well try
I'm going to
blow this whole mountain up
He screamed, Let's see you get out of this one, Dent
He rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to  be  a small black sacrificial altar
He was shouting so wildly now that
he was really carving his face up badly
Arthur leaped down  from his  vantage  place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try
to restrain the three-quarters-crazed creature
He leaped upon him, and brought the strange monstrosity  crashing down on top of the altar
Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief  moment,  and turned a wild eye on Arthur
You know what you've done
he gurgled painfully
You've  only gone  and  killed  me  again
i  mean, what do you want from me,
blood
He thrashed again  in  a  brief  apoplectic  fit,  quivered,  and
collapsed, smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so
Arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to have  done,  and  then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly shattered the air  to  announce  some  clamouring  emergency
He
stared wildly around him
The only exit appeared to be  the  way  he  came  in
He  pelted towards  it,  throwing away the nasty fake leopard-skin bag as he
did so
He dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, he seemed  to  be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons, sirens, flashing lights
Suddenly, he turned a corner and there was a light  in  front  of him
It wasn't flashing
It was daylight
Although it has been said that on Earth alone in  our  Galaxy  is Krikkit  (or cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that for this reason the Earth has been shunned, this does only  apply to our Galaxy, and more specifically to our dimension
In some of
the higher dimensions they feel they  can  more  or  less  please themselves, and have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian Ultra-Cricket for whatever their transdimensional  equivalent  of billions of years is
Let's be blunt, it's a nasty  game  (says  The  Hitch  Hiker's Guide  to the Galaxy) but then anyone who has been to any of the higher dimensions will know that they're a pretty  nasty  heathen lot  up  there  who should just be smashed and done in, and would be, too, if anyone could work out a way  of  firing  missiles  at right-angles to reality
This is another example of the fact that The Hitch Hiker's  Guide to  the  Galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the street and get ripped off, especially if they  happen  to walk in off the street during the afternoon, when very few of the regular staff are there
There is a fundamental point here
The history of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy  is  one  of idealism,  struggle,  despair,  passion,  success,  failure,  and enormously long lunch-breaks
The earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its financial records, lost in the mists of time
For other, and more curious theories about where they  are  lost, see below
Most of the surviving  stories,  however,  speak  of  a  founding editor called Hurling Frootmig
Hurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established  its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust
There followed many years of penury  and  heart-searching  during which  he  consulted  friends,  sat  in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind, thought about this and that,  fooled  about  with weights,  and  then,  after  a  chance  encounter  with  the Holy Lunching Friars of Voondon (who claimed that just as lunch was at the  centre of a man's temporal day, and man's temporal day could be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life, so Lunch should (a) be seen as the centre of a man's spiritual life, and (b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded  the  Guide, laid  down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them both, and led  the  Guide  on  to  its first major commercial success
He also started to develop and explore the role of the  editorial lunch-break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the Guide's history, since it meant that most of the actual  work got  done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing
Shortly  after  this,  the  Guide  was  taken  over  by  Megadodo Publications  of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on a very sound financial footing, and allowing the  fourth  editor, Lig Lury Jr, to embark on lunch-breaks of such breathtaking scope that even  the  efforts  of  recent  editors,  who  have  started undertaking  sponsored  lunch-breaks  for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in comparison
In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship -  he  merely left  his  office  late one morning and has never since returned
Though well over a century has now passed, many  members  of  the guide  staff  still retain the romantic notion that he has simply popped out for a ham croissant, and will yet return to put  in  a solid afternoon's work
Strictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr  have  therefore been designated Acting Editors, and Lig's desk is still preserved the way he left it, with the addition of a small sign which  says Lig Lury Jr, Editor, Missing, presumed Fed
Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that Lig   actually   perished  in  the  Guide's  first  extraordinary experiments in alternative book-keeping
Very little is known  of
this,  and  less  still  said
Anyone who even notices, let alone calls attention  to,  the  curious  but  utter  coincidental  and
meaningless fact that every world on which the Guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly  afterwards  perished  in warfare  or  some  natural  disaster,  is  liable  to get sued to smithereens
It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that  the  two or three days prior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass saw a  dramatic  upsurge  in  the number  of  UFO  sightings  there,  not  only above Lords Cricket Ground in St
John's Wood, London, but also above Glastonbury  in
Somerset
Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings, witchcraft,  ley-lines  an wart curing, and had now been selected as the site for the new Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  financial  records office,  and  indeed,  ten years' worth of financial records were transferred to a magic hill just  outside  the  city  mere  hours before the Vogons arrived
None of these facts,  however  strange  or  inexplicable,  is  as strange  or  inexplicable  as  the  rules of the game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket, as played in the higher dimensions
A full set  of
rules  is  so  massively complicated that the only time they were all  bound  together  in  a   single   volume,   they   underwent gravitational collapse and became a Black Hole
A brief summary, however, is as follows: Rule One: Grow at least three extra legs
You  won't  need  them,
but it keeps the crowds amused
Rule Two: Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricket player
Clone  him off  a  few  times
This  saves  an  enormous  amount of tedious
selection and training
Rule Three: Put your team and the opposing team in a large  field and build a high wall round them
The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator sport,  the  frustration  experienced  by  the  audience  at  not actually being able to see what's going on leads them to  imagine that it's a lot more exciting than it really is
A crowd that has
just watched a rather humdrum game  experiences  far  less  life- affirmation  than  a  crowd  that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history
Rule Four: Throw lots of assorted  items  of  sporting  equipment over  the  wall for the players
Anything will do - cricket bats,
basecube bats, tennis guns, skis, anything you  can  get  a  good swing with
Rule Five: The players should now lay about  themselves  for  all they are worth with whatever they find to hand
Whenever a player
scores a hit on another player, he should immediately run  away and apologize from a safe distance
Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and points, delivered through a megaphone
Rule Six: The winning team shall be the first team that wins
Curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game  grows  in the higher dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most of the competing teams are now in a state  of  permanent  warfare with  each  other over the interpretation of these rules
This is
all for the best, because in the long run a  good  solid  war  is less  psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket
As Arthur ran darting, dashing and panting down the side  of  the mountain  he  suddenly  felt  the whole bulk of the mountain move very, very slightly beneath him
There was a rumble, a roar,  and
a  slight  blurred  movement,  and a lick of heat in the distance behind and above him
He ran in a frenzy of fear
The land  began
to  slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word landslide in a way which had never been apparent  to  him  before
It  had
always  just  been  a  word  to  him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing  for land to do
It was doing it with him on it
He felt ill with fear
and shaking
The ground slid, the mountain slurred,  he  slipped, he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran
The avalance began
Stones, then rocks, then boulders which  pranced  past  him  like clumsy  puppies,  only  much,  much bigger, much, much harder and heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill  you  if  they fell  on you
His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the
dancing ground
He ran as if  running  was  a  terrible  sweating sickness,  his  heart  pounded  to  the  rhythm  of  the pounding
geological frenzy around him
The logic of the situation, i
e
that he  was  clearly  bound  to survive  if  the  next  foreshadowed  incident in the saga of his
inadvertent persecution of Agrajag was  to  happen,  was  utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this time
He ran with the fear of  death  in
him, under him, over him and grabbing hold of his hair
And suddenly he tripped again  and  was  hurled  forward  by  his considerable  momentum
But just at the moment that he was about
to hit the ground astoundingly hard  he  saw  lying  directly  in front of him a small navy-blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage-retrieval system at Athens  airport  some ten  years  in  his  personal  time-scale  previously, and in his astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off  into the air with his brain singing
What he was doing was this: he was flying
He glanced around  him in  surprise,  but  there could be no doubt that that was what he
was doing
No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of him  was  even  approaching it
He was simply floating there with
boulders hurtling through the air around him
He could now do something about  that
Blinking  with  the  non- effort  of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders
were hurtling through the air beneath him
He looked downwards with intense curiosity
Between him  and  the shivering  ground  were  now some thirty feet of empty air, empty
that is if you discounted the boulders which didn't  stay  in  it for  long,  but  bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity; the same law which seemed, all  of  a  sudden,  to  have given Arthur a sabbatical
It  occurred  to  him  almost  instantly,  with  the  instinctive correctness  that self-preservation  instils in the mind, that he mustn't try to think about it, that if he did, the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up  there,  and  all  would suddenly be lost
So he thought about tulips
It was  difficult,  but  he  did
He thought  about  the  pleasing  firm  roundness  of  the bottom of
tulips, he thought about the interesting variety of colours  they came  in,  and  wondered  what  proportion of the total number of tulips that grew, or had grown,  on  the  Earth  would  be  found within a radius of one mile from a windmill
After a while he got
dangerously bored with  this  train  of  thought,  felt  the  air slipping  away  beneath  him, felt that he was drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not to  think about, so he thought about Athens airport for a bit and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes  -  at  the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating about two hundred yards above the ground
He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it, but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and tried to look at the situation steadily
He was flying, What was he going to do about it
He  looked  back down  at  the ground
He didn't look at it hard, but did his best
just to give it an idle glance, as it  were,  in  passing
There were  a  couple of things he couldn't help noticing
One was that
the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have  spent  itself  - there was a crater just a little way beneath the peak, presumably where the rock  had  caved  in  on  top  of  the  huge  cavernous cathedral,  the statue of himself, and the sadly abused figure of Agrajag
The other was his  hold-all,  the  one  he  had  lost  at  Athens airport
It  was  sitting  pertly  on  a  piece of clear ground,
surrounded by exhausted boulders but apparently hit  by  none  of them
Why  this should be he could not speculate, but since this
mystery   was   completely   overshadowed   by   the    monstrous impossibility of the bag's being there in the first place, it was not a speculation he really felt strong enough  for  anyway
The
thing  is,  it  was  there
And the nasty, fake leopard-skin bag seemed to have disappeared, which was all to  the  good,  if  not
entirely to the explicable
He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick  the thing  up
Here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the
surface of an alien planet the name of  which  he  couldn't  even remember
He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny
piece of what used to be his life, here, so many light-years from the pulverized remains of his home
Furthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in  the  state in  which  he lost it, would contain a can which would have in it the only Greek olive oil still surviving in the Universe
Slowly, carefully, inch by  inch,  he  began  to  bob  downwards, swinging  gently  from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper feeling its way towards the ground
It went well, he was feeling good
The air supported him, but let him  through
Two  minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet
above the bag, and was faced with  some  difficult  decision
He bobbed  there  lightly
He  frowned, but again, as lightly as he
could
If he picked the bag up, could he carry it
Mightn't  the  extra weight just pull him straight to the ground
Mightn't the  mere  act  of  touching  something  on  the  ground suddenly  discharge   whatever  mysterious  force it was that was holding him in the air
Mightn't he be better off just being sensible at this  point  and stepping  out  of  the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two
If he did, would he ever be able to fly again
The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was  so quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it, perhaps for ever
With this worry in mind  he  bobbed  upwards  a
little  again,  just  to  try  the feel of it, the surprising and effortless movement of it
He bobbed,  he  floated
He  tried  a
little swoop
The swoop was terrific
With his arms spread out in front of him, his  hair  and  dressing  gown streaming out behind him, he dived
down out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about  two  feet from  the ground and swung back up again, catching himself at the top of the swing and holding
Just holding
He stayed there
It was wonderful
And that, he realized, was the way of  picking  up  the  bag
He would  swoop  down  and catch hold of it just at the point of the
upswing
He would carry it on up with him
He might wobble a bit, but he was certain that he could hold it
He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and better
The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all
combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit  that  he hadn't  felt  since,  since  -  well as far as he could work out, since he was born
He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the
countryside,  which  was,  he  discovered, pretty nasty
It had a wasted ravaged look
He decided not to look at it  any  more
He
would  just  pick  up the bag and then
he didn't know what he was going to do after he had picked up the  bag
He  decided  he
would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there
He judged himself against the wind,  pushed  up  against  it  and turned around
He floated on its body
He didn't realize, but his
body was willoming at this point
He ducked down under the airstream, dipped - and dived
The air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it
The ground wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly
up to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles  up towards him
Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no longer  believe  he  was doing this, and therefore he very nearly wasn't, but he  recovered  himself  in  time,  skimmed  over  the ground,  slipped  an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag, and began to climb back up, couldn't make it and all of a  sudden collapsed, bruised, scratched and shaking in the stony ground
He staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly  around, swinging the bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment
His feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in  the  way they  always  had  been
His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of
potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground, his  mind  had all the lightness of a bag of lead
He  sagged  and  swayed  and  ached  with  giddiness
He   tried hopelessly  to  run,  but  his  legs  were  suddenly too weak
He
tripped and flopped forward
At that moment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil
but a duty-free allowance of  retsina,  and  in  the  pleasurable shock  of  that  realization he failed to notice for at least ten seconds that he was now flying again
He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical delight
He  swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through
the air
Cheekily he sat on an updraught  and  went  through  the contents  of  the  hold-all
He felt the way he imagined an angel
must feel during its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst being  counted  by  philosophers
He laughed with pleasure at the
discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and  the retsina as well as a pair of cracked sunglasses, some sand-filled swimming trunks, some creased postcards of Santorini, a large and unsightly  towel,  some interesting stones, and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he was relieved  to  think  he would  never meet again, even if the reason why was a sad one
He
dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, and let the pieces  of paper whip away in the wind
Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a  large and  extremely  disreputable  cocktail  party in the small of the back
The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into  its fourth  generation,  and still no one shows any signs of leaving
Somebody did once look at his watch, but that  was  eleven  years ago, and there has been no follow-up
The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but if  you  don't have any particular need to believe it, then don't go and look, because you won't enjoy it
There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, and  there  is  one  theory  that  this  is a battle being fought between the fleets of several rival carpet-cleaning companies who are  hovering  over  the  thing  like vultures, but you shouldn't believe anything  you  hear  at  parties,  and  particularly  not anything you hear at this one
One of the problems, and it's one which is obviously going to get worse,  is  that  all  the  people  at  the  party are either the children or the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren  of  the people  who wouldn't leave in the first place, and because of all the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so on,  it  means  that  all  the people now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers, or gibbering  idiots,  or,  more and more frequently, both
Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each  succeeding generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one
So other factors come into operation,  like  when  the  drink  is going to run out
Now, because of certain things which have happened  which  seemed like  a  good  idea  at  the time (and one of the problems with a party which never stops is that all the things  which  only  seem like  a  good  idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas), that point seems still to be a long way off
One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the  time  was that  the party should fly - not in the normal sense that parties are meant to fly, but literally
One night, long ago, a band of  drunken  astro-engineers  of  the first  generation  clambered  round  the  building  digging this, fixing that, banging very hard on the other and when the sun rose the  following morning, it was startled to find itself shining on a building full of happy drunken people which  was  now  floating like a young and uncertain bird over the treetops
Not only that, but the flying  party  had  also  managed  to  arm itself  rather heavily
If they were going to get involved in any
petty arguments with wine merchants, they  wanted  to  make  sure they had might on their side
The transition from full-time cocktail party to part-time raiding party  came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest and swing to the whole affair which  was  badly  needed  at  this point  because  of the enormous number of times that the band had already played all the numbers it knew over the years
They looted, they raided, they held whole cities for  ransom  for fresh  supplies  of  cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and wine and spirits, which would now get piped aboard from  floating tankers
The problem of when the drink is going to run  out  is,  however, going to have to be faced one day
The planet over which they are floating is no longer  the  planet it was when they first started floating over it
It is in bad shape
The party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no  one has  ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky
It is one hell of a party
It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of  the back
Arthur lay  floundering  in  pain  on  a  piece  of  ripped  and dismembered  reinforced  concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing cloud and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking  somewhere indistinctly behind him
There was  a  sound  he  couldn't  immediately  identify,  partly because  he  didn't  know the tune I Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta and partly because the band playing it were very tired, and  some members  of  it were playing it in three-four time, some in four- four, and some in a kind of pie-eyed r2,  each according  to  the amount of sleep he'd managed to grab recently
He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of himself  to  see  where  he  might  be  hurt
Wherever he touched
himself, he encountered a pain
After a short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that was hurting
He seemed
to have sprained his wrist
His back, too, was  hurting,  but  he soon  satisfied  himself  that  he  was  not badly hurt, but just
bruised and a little shaken, as  who  wouldn't  be
He  couldn't understand  what  a  building  would  be doing flying through the
clouds
On the other hand, he would have been a  little  hard-pressed  to come  up  with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so he decided that he and the building were just going  to  have  to accept  each  other
He looked up from where he was lying
A wall
of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him, the  building proper
He  seemed  to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or
lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all  the way  around
It  was  a  hunk  of  the ground in which the party
building had had its foundations, and which it  had  taken  along with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end
Nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the  edge, he  felt  nauseous  with vertigo
He pressed himself back against
the wall,  wet  with  mist  and  sweat
His  head  was  swimming freestyle, but someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly
Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could  now not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him
He
was not about to try his luck jumping
He was not about  to  move an inch closer to the edge
Clutching his hold-all he edged along the wall, hoping to find  a doorway  in
The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great
reassurance to him
He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope that  the  wall  around the corner might offer more in the way of entrances than this one, which offered none
The unsteadiness of the building's flight made him feel sick with fear,  and  after a short while he took the towel from out of his hold-all and did something with it which once again justified its supreme  position  in  the list of useful things to take with you when you hitch-hike round the Galaxy
He put it over his head  so
he wouldn't have to see what he was doing
His feet edged along the  ground
His  outstretched  hand  edged along the wall
Finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner it  encountered  something  which  gave  him such a shock that he nearly fell straight off
It was another hand
The two hands gripped each other
He desperately wanted to use his other hand  to  pull  the  towel back  from  his  eyes,  but  it was holding the hold-all with the olive oil, the retsina and the postcards from Santorini,  and  he very much didn't want to put it down
He experienced one of those self moments, one of those  moments when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think Who am I
What am I up to
What have I achieved
Am I doing well
He
whimpered very slightly
He tried to free his hand, but he couldn't
The  other  hand  was holding  his  tightly
He  had  no  recourse but to edge onwards
towards the corner
He leaned around it and shook his head in  an attempt to dislodge the towel
This seemed to provoke a sharp cry
of some unfashionable emotion from the owner of the other hand
The towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering into  those of Ford Prefect
Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, and
beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and  a  large  closed door
They were both pressed back against  the  wall,  eyes  wild  with terror as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them, and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building
Where the zarking photon have  you  been
hissed  Ford,  panic stricken
Er, well, stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how  to  sum  it all up that briefly
Here and there
What are you doing here
Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again
They won't let us in without a bottle, he hissed
The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick  of the  party,  apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild profusion of colours that protuded dimly through  the  atmosphere of  heavy  smoke,  the  carpets  thick with ground glass, ash and avocado  droppings,  and  the  small  group  of  pterodactyl-like creatures  in  lurex  who  descended  on  his cherished bottle of retsina,  squawking,  A  new  pleasure,  a  new  pleasure,  was Trillian being chatted up by a Thunder God
Didn't I see you at Milliways
he was saying
Were you the one with the hammer
Yes
I much prefer it here
So much less reputable, so much more
fraught
Squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room, the  outer
dimensions  of which were invisible through the heaving throng of happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully  yelling  things  that  nobody could hear at each other and occasionally having crises
Seems fun, said Trillian
What did you say, Arthur
I said, how the hell did you get here
I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the Universe
Have you met Thor
He makes thunder
Hello, said Arthur
I expect that must be very interesting
Hi, said Thor
It is
Have you got a drink
Er, no actually
Then why don't you go and get one
See you later, Arthur, said Trillian
Something jogged Arthur's mind, and he looked around huntedly
Zaphod isn't here, is he
he said
See you, said Trillian firmly, later
Thor glared at him with hard coal-black eyes, his beard bristled,
what  little light was there was in the place mustered its forces briefly to glint menacingly off the horns of his helmet
He took Trillian's elbow in his  extremely  large  hand  and  the muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of Volkswagens parking
He led her away
One of the interesting things about being  immortal,  he  said, is
One  of  the  interesting  things  about  space,  Arthur  heard Slartibartfast  saying  to  a  large  and voluminous creature who looked like someone losing a fight with  a  pink  duvet  and  was gazing  raptly  at  the old man's deep eyes and silver beard, is how dull it is
Dull
said the creature, and blinked her  rather  wrinkled  and bloodshot eyes
Yes, said Slartibartfast, staggeringly dull
Bewilderingly so
You  see,  there's  so  much of it and so little in it
Would you like me to quote some statistics
Er, well
Please, I would like to
They,  too,  are  quite  sensationally
dull
I'll come back and hear them in a moment, she said, patting him
on  the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off into the heaving crown
I thought she'd never go, growled the old man
Come,  Earthman
Arthur
We must find the Silver Bail, it is here somewhere
Can't we just relax a little
Arthur said
I've  had  a  tough day
Trillian's  here,  incidentally,  she  didn't  say  how, it
probably doesn't matter
Think of the danger to the Universe
The Universe, said Arthur, is big enough  and  old  enough  to look  after  itself  for  half  an hour
All right, he added, in
response to Slartibartfast's increasing agitation,  I'll  wander round and see if anybody's seen it
Good, good, said Slartibartfast, good
He plunged  into  the crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed
Have you seen a bail anywhere
said Arthur to a little man  who seemed  to  be  standing  eagerly  waiting to listen to somebody
It's made of silver, vitally important for the future safety  of the Universe, and about this long
No, said the enthusiastically wizened little man, but do  have a drink and tell me all about it
Ford Prefect writhed past,  dancing  a  wild,  frenetic  and  not entirely  unobscene  dance  with someone who looked as if she was wearing Sydney Opera House on her head
He was yelling  a  futile
conversation at her above the din
I like that hat
he bawled
What
I said, I like the hat
I'm not wearing a hat
Well, I like the head, then
What
I said, I like the head
Interesting bone-structure
What
Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of  other  movements
he was performing
I said, you dance great, he shouted, just don't nod so much
What
It's just that every time you nod,  said  Ford,
ow
he added as his partner nodded forward to say What
and once again
pecked him sharply on the forehead with  the  sharp  end  of  her swept-forward skull
My planet was blown up one morning, said Arthur, who had  found himself  quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or, at least, edited highlights of it, that's  why  I'm  dressed like  this,  in my dressing gown
My planet was blown up with all
my clothes in it, you see
I didn't realize I'd be  coming  to  a party
The little man nodded enthusiastically
Later, I was thrown off a spaceship
Still in my dressing  gown
Rather  than  the  space  suit one would normally expect
Shortly after that I discovered that my planet had originally  been built
for a bunch of mice
You can imagine how I felt about that
I was then shot at for a while and blown up
In fact I have been  blown
up    ridiculously    often,   shot   at,   insulted,   regularly disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently  I  crashed  into  a swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave
Ah, effervesced the little man, and did you have  a  wonderful time
Arthur started to choke violently on his drink
What a wonderful exciting cough, said  the  little  man,  quite startled by it, do you mind if I join you
And with  that  he  launched  into  the  most  extraordinary  and spectacular  fit  of  coughing  which  caught  Arthur  so much by surprise that he started to choke violently,  discovered  he  was already doing it and got thoroughly confused
Together they performed a lung-busting duet  which  went  on  for fully  two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to a halt
So invigorating, said the little man, panting and wiping  tears from  his  eyes
What an exciting life you must lead
Thank you
very much
He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd
Arthur shook his head in astonishment
A youngish-looking man came up to him, an aggressive-looking type with  a  hook  mouth,  a  lantern  nose,  and  small beady little cheekbones
He was wearing black trousers,  a  black  silk  shirt
open  to  what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt never to make assumptions about the  anatomies  of  the  sort  of people  he  tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold things hanging round his neck
He  carried  something
in  a  black  bag,  and  clearly  wanted people to notice that he didn't want them to notice it
Hey, er, did I hear you say your name just now
he said
This was one  of  the  many  things  that  Arthur  had  told  the enthusiastic little man
Yes, it's Arthur Dent
The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm  other  than
any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out
Yeah, he said, only there was a man in a  mountain  wanted  to see you
I met him
Yeah, only he seemed pretty anxious about it, you know
Yes, I met him
Yeah, well I think you should know that
I do
I met him
The man paused to chew a little gum
Then he  clapped  Arthur  on
the back
OK, he said, all right
I'm  just  telling  you,  right
Good night, good luck, win awards
What
said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder  seriously  at this point
Whatever
Do what you do
Do  it  well
He  made  a  sort  of clucking noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely
dynamic gesture
Why
said Arthur
Do it badly, said the man, who cares
Who gives a  shit
The blood  suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man's face and he
started to shout
Why not go mad
he said
Go away, get off my  back  will  you, guy
Just zark off
OK, I'm going, said Arthur hurriedly
It's been real
The man gave a sharp wave and  disappeared  off into the throng
What was that about
said Arthur to a girl  he  found  standing beside him
Why did he tell me to win awards
Just showbiz talk, shrugged the girl
He's just won  an  award at  the  Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute
Awards Ceremony, and was  hoping  to  be  able  to  pass  it  off lightly, only you didn't mention it, so he couldn't
Oh, said Arthur, oh, well I'm sorry  I  didn't
What  was  it for
The Most  Gratuitous  Use  Of  The  Word  `Fuck'  In  A  Serious Screenplay
It's very prestigious
I see, said Arthur, yes, and what do you get for that
A Rory
It's just a small silver thing  set  on  a  large  black
base
What did you say
I didn't say anything
I was just about to ask what  the  silver
Oh, I thought you said `wop'
Said what
Wop
People had been dropping in on the  party  now  for  some  years, fashionable  gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it had occurred to the partygoers as they had looked  out  at  their own  world  beneath  them,  with  its wrecked cities, its ravaged avocado farms and blighted vineyards,  its  vast  tracts  of  new desert,  its  seas  full  of biscuit crumbs and worse, that their world was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it had been
Some of them had begun to wonder if they
could manage to stay sober for long enough  to  make  the  entire party  spaceworthy  and  maybe take it off to some other people's worlds where the  air  might  be  fresher  and  give  them  fewer headaches
The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a feeble  existence on the half-dead ground of the planet's surface would have been extremely pleased to hear this, but that day,  as the party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in haggard fear of yet another cheese-and-wine raid, it became clear  that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for a while, that the party would soon be over
Very soon it would be
time  to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what time of day it was, what time of year it  was,  and whether  in  any  of this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere
The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a  strange  white spaceship  which  seemed to be half sticking through it
Together
they were lurching, heaving and spinning their way round the  sky in grotesque disregard of their own weight
The clouds parted
The air roared and leapt out of their way
The party and the Krikkit warship looked, in their  writhings,  a little  like  two  ducks,  one of which is trying to make a third duck inside the second duck, whilst the  second  duck  is  trying very  hard to explain that it doesn't feel ready for a third duck right now, is uncertain that it would  want  any  putative  third duck  to  be  made  by  this  particular  first  duck anyway, and certainly not whilst it, the second duck, was busy flying
The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it  all  and  buffeted the ground with shock waves
And suddenly, with a foop, the Krikkit ship was gone
The party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man  leaning against  an  unexpectedly  open  door
It span and wobbled on its
hover jets
It tried to right itself and wronged itself  instead
It staggered back across the sky again
For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly  they  could not  continue  for  long
The  party  was now a mortally wounded
party
All the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional  broken- backed pirouette could not disguise
The longer, at this  point,  that  it  avoided  the  ground,  the heavier was going to be the crash when finally it hit it
Inside, things were  not  going  well  either
They  were  going monstrously  badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying
so loudly
The Krikkit robots had been
They had removed the Award for The Most  Gratuitous  Use  Of  The Word  `Fuck' In A Serious Screenplay, and in its place had left a scene of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner-up for a Rory
We would love to stay and help, shouted Ford, picking  his  way over the mangled debris, only we're not going to
The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from amongst the smoking wreckage
We have to go and save the Universe, you see, said  Ford
And if  that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right
Either way, we're off
He suddenly came across an unopened  bottle  lying,  miraculously
unbroken, on the ground
Do you mind if we take this
he said
You  won't  be  needing it
He took a packet of potato crisps too
Trillian
shouted Arthur in a shocked and  weakened  voice
In the smoking mess he could see nothing
Earthman, we must go, said Slartibartfast nervously
Trillian
shouted Arthur again
A moment or two later, Trillian staggered,  shaking,  into  view, supported by her new friend the Thunder God
The girl stays with me, said Thor
There's a great party going on in Valhalla, we'll be flying off
Where were you when all this was going on
said Arthur
Upstairs, said Thor, I was weighing  her
Flying's  a  tricky business you see, you have to calculate wind
She comes with us, said Arthur
Hey, said Trillian, don't I
No, said Arthur, you come with us
Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes
He  was  making some  point  about  godliness and it had nothing to do with being
clean
She comes with me, he said quietly
Come on, Earthman, said Slartibartfast  nervously,  picking  at Arthur's sleeve
Come on, Slartibartfast, said Ford, picking at  the  old  man's sleeve
Slartibartfast had the teleport device
The party lurched and swayed, sending  everyone  reeling,  except for  Thor  and  except  for Arthur, who stared, shaking, into the Thunder God's black eyes
Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what appeared to  be  his  tiny little fists
Want to make something of it
he said
I beg your minuscule pardon
roared Thor
I said, repeated Arthur, and he could not  keep  the  quavering out  of  his  voice,  do  you  want to make something of it
He
waggled his fists ridiculously
Thor looked at him with incredulity
Then a little wisp of  smoke curled upwards from his nostril
There was a tiny little flame in
it too
He gripped his belt
He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was  the sort  of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with you
He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt
He held it  up in  his hands to reveal the massive iron head
He thus cleared up
any possible misunderstanding that  he  might  merely  have  been carrying a telegraph pole around with him
Do I want, he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through  a steel mill, to make something of it
Yes, said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong and  belligerent
He waggled his fists again, this time as if he
meant it
You want to step outside
he snarled at Thor
All right
bellowed Thor, like an enraged bull (or in fact like an  enraged  Thunder God, which is a great deal more impressive),
and did so
Good, said Arthur, that's got rid of him
Slarty, get  us  out of here
All right, shouted Ford at Arthur, so I'm a coward, the  point is   I'm  still  alive
They  were  back  aboard  the  Starship
Bistromath, so was Slartibartfast, so was Trillian
Harmony  and concord were not
Well, so am I alive, aren't I
retaliated Arthur, haggard  with adventure  and anger
His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if
they wanted to punch each other
You damn nearly weren't, exploded Ford
Arthur turned sharply to Slartibartfast, who was sitting  in  his pilot  couch  on  the  flight  deck  gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a bottle which was telling  him  something  he  clearly couldn't fathom
He appealed to him
Do you think he understands the first word I've been saying
he said, quivering with emotion
I don't know, replied Slartibartfast,  a  little  abstractedly
I'm  not sure, he added, glancing up very briefly, that I do
He stared at his instruments with renewed vigor  and  bafflement
You'll have to explain it to us again, he said
Well
But later
Terrible things are afoot
He tapped the pseudo-glass of the bottle bottom
We fared rather pathetically at the party, I'm afraid, he said, and our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the Key in the Lock
How in heaven we do that I don't  know,  he
muttered
Just have to go there, I suppose
Can't say I like the idea at all
Probably end up dead
Where is Trillian anyway
said Arthur with a sudden affectation of  unconcern
What  he  had  been angry about was that Ford had
berated him for wasting time  over  all  the  business  with  the Thunder  God when they could have been making a rather more rapid escape
Arthur's own opinion, and he had offered it for  whatever
anybody  might  have  felt  it  was  worth,  was that he had been extraordinarily brave and resourceful
The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys
What really hurt, though, was that
Trillian didn't seem to react much one way or the other  and  had wandered off somewhere
And where are my potato crisps
said Ford
They are both, said Slartibartfast, without looking up, in the Room  of  Informational  Illusions
I think that your young lady
friend is trying to understand some problems of Galactic history
I think the potato crisps are probably helping her
It is a mistake to think you can solve any  major  problems  just
with potatoes
For instance, there was  once  an  insanely  aggressive  race  of people  called  the  Silastic  Armorfiends of Striterax
That was
just the name of their race
The name of their army was something quite  horrific
Luckily they lived even further back in Galactic
history than anything we have so far encountered - twenty billion years  ago  - when the Galaxy was young and fresh, and every idea worth fighting for was a new one
And fighting was what the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax  were good  at, and being good at it, they did a lot
They fought their
enemies (i
e
everybody else),  they  fought  each  other
Their planet  was  a  complete  wreck
The  surface  was littered with
abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war machines, which  were  in  turn  surrounded  by  deep  bunkers in which the Silastic Armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other
The best way to pick a fight with a Silastic Armorfiend was  just to  be born
They didn't like it, they got resentful
And when an
Armorfiend got resentful, someone got hurt
An exhausting way  of life,  one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of
energy
The best way of dealing with a Silastic Armorfiend was to put him into  a  room of his own, because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up
Eventually they realized that this was something they were  going to  have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who had to carry a weapon as part of  his  normal  Silastic  work (policemen,  security  guards, primary school teachers, etc
had
to spend at least forty-five minutes every day punching a sack of potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggressions
For a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would be  much more efficient and less time-consuming if they just shot the potatoes instead
This led to a  renewed  enthusiasm  for  shooting  all  sorts  of things,  and  they  all got very excited at the prospect of their first major war for weeks
Another achievement of the Silastic Armorfiends of  Striterax  is that  they  were  the  first  race  who  ever  managed to shock a computer
It was a gigantic spaceborne computer  called  Hactar,  which  to this day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built
It
was the first to be built like a natural  brain,  in  that  every cellular  particle  of it carried the pattern of the whole within it, which enabled it to think more  flexibly  and  imaginatively, and also, it seemed, to be shocked
The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax  were  engaged  in  one  of their  regular  wars  with the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and were not enjoying it as much as  usual  because  it  involved  an awful  lot of trekking through the Radiation Swamps of Cwulzenda, and across the Fire Mountains  of  Frazfraga,  neither  of  which terrains they felt at home in
So when the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined  in  the fray and forced them to fight another front in the Gamma Caves of Carfrax and the Ice Storms of  Varlengooten,  they  decided  that enough  was enough, and they ordered Hactar to design for them an Ultimate Weapon
What do you mean, asked Hactar, by Ultimate
To which the Silastic Armorfiends  of  Striterax  said,  Read  a
bloody dictionary, and plunged back into the fray
So Hactar designed an Ultimate Weapon
It was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in hyperspace that would, when activated, connect the heart of every major sun with the heart of every other major sun  simultaneously and thus turn the entire Universe in to one gigantic hyperspatial supernova
When the Silastic Armorfiends tried  to  use  it  to  blow  up  a Strangulous  Stilettan  munitions dump in one of the Gamma Caves, they were extremely irritated that it didn't work, and said so
Hactar had been shocked by the whole idea
He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this Ultimate Weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse  than  the known  consequence  of setting it off, and he had therefore taken the liberty of introducing a small flaw into the  design  of  the bomb,  and  he  hoped  that  everyone  involved  would,  on sober reflection, feel that
The Silastic Armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer
Later they thought better of it, and destroyed the faulty bomb as well
Then, pausing only  to  smash  the  hell  out  of  the  Strenuous Garfighters   of   Stug,   and   the  Strangulous  Stilettans  of Jajazikstak, they went on to find an entirely new way of  blowing themselves  up,  which  was a profound relief to everyone else in the Galaxy, particularly the Garfighters, the Stilettans and  the potatoes
Trillian had watched all this, as well as the story  of  Krikkit
She   emerged   from   the   Room   of   informational  Illusions thoughtfully, just in time to discover that they had arrived  too late
Even as the Starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on the  top of a small cliff on the mile-wide asteroid which pursued a lonely and eternal path  in  orbit  around  the  enclosed  star system of Krikkit, its crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event
They didn't realize they were going to see two
They stood cold, lonely  and  helpless  on  the  cliff  edge  and watched  the  activity below
Lances of light wheeled in sinister
arcs against the void from a point only  about  a  hundred  yards below and in front of them
They stared into the blinding event
An extension of the ship's field enabled them to stand there,  by once  again  exploiting  the mind's predisposition to have tricks played on it: the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid, or of not being able to breathe, simply became Somebody Else's
The white Krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags of   the   asteroid,   alternately  flaring  under  arclights  or disappearing in shadow
The blackness of the shaped shadows  cast
by  the  hard  rocks  danced together in wild choreography as the arclights swept round them
The eleven white robots were bearing, in procession,  the  Wikkit Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights
The Wikkit Key was rebuilt
Its components shone  and  glittered: the  Steel  Pillar  (or  Marvin's leg) of Strength and Power, the
Gold Bail (or Heart of the Improbability  Drive)  of  Prosperity, the  Perspex Pillar (or Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice) of Science and  Reason,  the  Silver  Bail  (or  Rory  Award  for  The  Most Gratuitous  Use  Of  The Word Fuck In A Serious Screenplay) and the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar (or Ashes of  a  burnt  stump signifying   the   death   of  English  cricket)  of  Nature  and Spirituality
I suppose there is nothing we  can  do  at  this  point
asked Arthur nervously
No, sighed Slartibartfast
The expression of disappointment which crossed Arthur's face  was a  complete  failure,  and,  since  he  was  standing obscured by shadow, he allowed it to collapse into one of relief
Pity, he said
We have no weapons, said Slartibartfast, stupidly
Damn, said Arthur very quietly
Ford said nothing
Trillian  said  nothing,  but  in  a  peculiarly  thoughtful  and distinct  way
She  was  staring  at  the blankness of the space
beyond the asteroid
The asteroid circled the Dust Cloud which surrounded the Slo-Time envelope  which  enclosed  the world on which lived the people of Krikkit, the Masters of Krikkit and their killer robots
The helpless group had no way  of  knowing  whether  or  not  the Krikkit  robots  were  aware  of  their presence
They could only
assume that they must be, but that they felt,  quite  rightly  in the  circumstances,  that  they  had nothing to fear
They had an
historic task to perform, and their audience  could  be  regarded with contempt
Terrible impotent feeling,  isn't  it
said  Arthur,  but  the others ignored him
In the centre  of  the  area  of  light  which  the  robots  were approaching,  a  square-shaped  crack appeared in the ground
The
crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became clear  that  a  block  of  the ground, about six feet square, was slowly rising
At the same time they became aware of some other movement, but it was  almost  sublimal,  and  for a moment or two it was not clear what it was that was moving
Then it became clear
The asteroid was moving
It was moving slowly in towards the Dust Cloud,  as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler
in its depths
They were to make in real life  the  journey  through  the  Cloud which  they  had  already  made  in  the  Room  of  Informational Illusions
They stood frozen in silence
Trillian frowned
An age seemed to  pass
Events  seemed  to  pass  with  spinning slowness,  as  the  leading  edge of the asteroid passed into the
vague and soft outer perimeter of the Cloud
And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity
They passed  on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and
whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner  of the eye
The Dust dimmed the shafts of  brilliant  light
The  shafts  of brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of Dust
Trillian,  again,  regarded  the  passage  from  within  her  own frowning thoughts
And they were through it
Whether it had taken a minute  or  half an  hour  they  weren't  sure,  but  they  were  through  it  and
confronted with a fresh blankness, as if space were  pinched  out of existence in front of them
And now things moved quickly
A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode  from  out  of the  block  which had risen three feet out of the ground, and out of that rose a smaller  Perspex  block,  dazzling  with  interior dancing colours
The block was slotted with deep groves,  three  upright  and  two across, clearly designed to accept the Wikkit key
The robots approached the Lock, slotted the Key into its home and stepped back again
The block twisted round of is own accord, and
space began to alter
As space unpinched itself, it seemed  agonizingly  to  twist  the eyes  of  the  watchers  in  their sockets
They found themselves
staring, blinded, at an unravelled sun  which  stood  now  before them  where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space
It was  a  second  or  two  before  they  were  even
sufficiently  aware  of what had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified blinded eyes
In that second  or  two,  they
were  aware  of a tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that sun
They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison
Krikkit
Krikkit
Krikkit
Krikkit
The sound chilled them
It was harsh, it was cold, it was  empty,
it was mechanically dismal
It was also triumphant
They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost missed the second historic event
Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to  survive  a  direct blast  attack  from  the  Krikkit  robots, ran out of the Krikkit warship brandishing a Zap gun
OK, he cried, the situation is totally  under  control  as  of this moment in time
The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung his  battleclub,  and connected it with the back of Zaphod's left head
Who  the  zark  did  that
said  the  left  head,  and  lolled sickeningly forward
His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance
Who did what
it said
The club connected with the back of his right head
Zaphod measured his length as  a  rather  strange  shape  on  the ground
Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over
A few blasts from  the robots were sufficient to destroy the Lock for ever
It
split and melted and splayed its contents  brokenly
The  robots marched  grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened
manner, back into their warship which, with a foop, was gone
Trillian and Ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox
I don't know, said Zaphod, for what  seemed  to  him  like  the thirty-seventh time, they could have killed me, but they didn't
Maybe they just  thought  I  was  a  kind  of  wonderful  guy  or something
I could understand that
The others silently registered their opinions of this theory
Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck
His back  seemed to  wrestle  the  floor as pain thudded through him and banged at
his heads
I think, he whispered, that  there  is  something  wrong  with those anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird
They are programmed to kill everybody,  Slartibartfast  pointed out
That, wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, could be it
He didn't seem altogether convinced
Hey, baby, he said to Trillian, hoping this would make  up  for his previous behaviour
You all right
she said gently
Yeah, he said, I'm fine
Good, she said, and walked away to think
She  stared  at  the
huge  visiscreen  over the flight couches and, twisting a switch, she flipped local images over it
One image was the blankness  of
the  Dust  Cloud
One  was  the  sun of Krikkit
One was Krikkit itself
She flipped between them fiercely
Well, that's goodbye Galaxy, then, said  Arthur,  slapping  his knees and standing up
No, said Slartibartfast, gravely
Our  course  is  clear
He furrowed  his  brow until you could grow some of the smaller root
vegetables in it
He stood up, he paced  around
When  he  spoke again,  what  he  said  frightened him so much he had to sit down
again
We must go down to Krikkit, he said
A deep sigh shook his  old frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets
Once again,  he  said,  we  have  failed  pathetically
Quite pathetically
That, said Ford quietly, is because we don't  care  enough
I told you
He swung his feet up on the instrument panel and picked  fitfully at something on one of his fingernails
But unless we determine  to  take  action,  said  the  old  man querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his nature, then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die
Surely we care about that
Not enough to want to get killed over it, said Ford
He put  on
a  sort  of  hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who wanted to see it
Slartibartfast  clearly  found  this  point  of  view   extremely seductive and he fought against it
He turned again to Zaphod who
was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain
You surely must have some idea, he said, of  why  they  spared your life
It seems most strange and unusual
I kind of think they didn't even know, shrugged Zaphod
I told you
They hit me with the most feeble blast, just knocked me out,
right
They lugged me into their ship, dumped me  into  a  corner and  ignored me
Like they were embarrassed about me being there
If I said anything they knocked me out again
We had  some  great conversations
Hey
ugh
Hi  there
ugh
I wonder
ugh
Kept me amused for hours, you know
He winced again
He was toying with something in his fingers
He held  it  up
It was  the Gold Bail - the Heart of Gold, the heart of the Infinite
Improbability Drive
Only that and the Wooden Pillar had survived the destruction of the Lock intact
I hear your ship can move a bit, he said
So  how  would  you like to zip me back to mine before you
Will you not help us
said Slartibartfast
I'd love to stay and help you save the Galaxy, insisted Zaphod, rising himself up on to his shoulders, but I have the mother and father of a pair of  headaches,  and  I  feel  a  lot  of  little headaches coming on
But next time it needs saving, I'm your guy
Hey, Trillian baby
She looked round briefly
Yes
You want to come
Heart of Gold
Excitement  and  adventure  and
really wild things
I'm going down to Krikkit, she said
It was the same hill, and yet not the same
This time it was not an Informational Illusion
This was  Krikkit itself and they were standing on it
Near them, behind the trees,
stood the strange Italian restaurant  which  had  brought  these, their real bodies, to this, the real, present world of Krikkit
The strong grass under their feet was real, the  rich  soil  real too
The  heady  fragrances  from  the tree, too, were real
The
night was real night
Krikkit
Possibly the most dangerous place in the Galaxy  for  anyone  who isn't  a Krikkiter to stand
The place that could not countenance
the existence of any other  place,  whose  charming,  delightful, intelligent  inhabitants  would  howl  with  fear,  savagery  and murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own
Arthur shuddered
Slartibartfast shuddered
Ford, surprisingly, shuddered
It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was  surprising  that he  was  there  at  all
But when they had returned Zaphod to his
ship Ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away
Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong wrong  wrong
He  hugged  to himself  one of the Zap guns with which they had armed themselves
out of Zaphod's armoury
Trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky
This, too, was not the same
It was no longer blank and empty
Whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the  two thousand  years of the Krikkit wars, and the mere five years that had elapsed locally since Krikkit  was  sealed  in  its  Slo-Time envelope   ten  billion  years  ago,  the  sky  was  dramatically different
Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it
High in the sky, where no Krikkiter ever  looked,  were  the  War Zones,  the Robot Zones - huge warships and tower blocks floating in the Nil-O-Grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands  of the surface of Krikkit
Trillian stared at them and thought
Trillian, whispered Ford Prefect to her
Yes
she said
What are you doing
Thinking
Do you always breathe like that when you're thinking
I wasn't aware that I was breathing
That's what worried me
I think I know
said Trillian
Shhhh
said Slartibartfast in alarm,  and  his  thin  trembling hand motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree
Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights  coming  along the  hill  path,  but  this  time the dancing beams were not from lanterns but electric torches - not in itself a dramatic  change, but  every  detail  made  their hearts thump with fear
This time
there were no lilting whimsical songs about flowers  and  farming and dead dogs, but hushed voices in urgent debate
A light moved in the sky with slow weight
Arthur  was  clenched with  a  claustrophobic  terror  and  the warm wind caught at his
throat
Within seconds a second party became  visible,  approaching  from the  other  side  of  the dark hill
They were moving swiftly and
purposefully, their torches swinging and probing around them
The parties were clearly converging, and  not  merely  with  each other
They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur
and the others were standing
Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his Zap gun to   his   shoulder,   and   the   slight   whimpering  cough  as Slartibartfast raised his
He felt the cold unfamiliar weight  of
his own gun, and with shaking hands he raised it
His fingers fumbled to release the safety catch  and  engage  the extreme  danger  catch  as  Ford had shown him
He was shaking so
much that if he'd fired at anybody at  that  moment  he  probably would have burnt his signature on them
Only Trillian didn't raise her  gun
She  raised  her  eyebrows, lowered them again, and bit her lip in thought
Has it occurred to you, she began, but nobody wanted to discuss anything much at the moment
A light stabbed through the darkness from behind  them  and  they span  around  to  find  a  third party of Krikkiters behind them, searching them out with their torches
Ford Prefect's gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back  at  it and it crashed from his hands
There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen  second  before  anyone fired again
And at the end of the second nobody fired
They were surrounded  by  pale-faced  Krikkiters  and  bathed  in bobbing torch light
The captives stared at their captors, the captors stared at their captives
Hello
said one of the captors
Excuse me,  but  are  you
aliens
Meanwhile,  more  millions  of  miles  away  than  the  mind  can
comfortably  encompass,  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  throwing a mood again
He had repaired his ship -  that  is,  he'd  watched  with  alert interest  whilst  a service robot had repaired it for him
It was
now, once again, one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in  existence
He could go anywhere, do anything
He fiddled with
a book, and then tossed it away
It was the one he'd read before
He walked over to the communications  bank  and  opened  an  all- frequencies emergency channel
Anyone want a drink
he said
This an emergency, feller
crackled a voice from halfway across the Galaxy
Got any mixers
said Zaphod
Go take a ride on a comet
OK, OK, said Zaphod and flipped  the  channel  shut  again
He
sighed  and  sat  down
He  got  up again and wandered over to a computer screen
He pushed a few buttons
Little blobs started to
rush around the screen eating each other
Pow
said Zaphod
Freeeoooo
Pop pop pop
Hi there, said the computer brightly after a  minute  of  this,
you have scored three points
Previous best score, seven million five hundred and ninety-seven thousand, two hundred and
OK, OK, said Zaphod and flipped the screen blank again
He sat down again
He played with a pencil
This too began slowly to lose its fascination
OK, OK, he said, and fed his score and the  previous  one  into the computer
His ship made a blur of the Universe
Tell us, said the thin, pale-faced Krikkiter  who  had  stepped forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the circle of torchlight, handling his gun as if he was just  holding it  for someone else who'd just popped off somewhere but would be back in a minute, do you know anything  about  something  called the Balance of Nature
There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing  more articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts
The torchlight
continued to play over them
High in  the  sky  above  them  dark activity continued in the Robot zones
It's just, continued  the  Krikkiter  uneasily,  something  we heard  about,  probably  nothing  important
Well, I suppose we'd
better kill you then
He looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find  which  bit
to press
That is, he said, looking up again,  unless  there's  anything you want to chat about
Slow, numb astonishment crept up the  bodies  of  Slartibartfast, Ford  and  Arthur
Very  soon it would reach their brains, which
were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones  up and  down
Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a
jigsaw by shaking the box
We're worried, you see, said another man from the crowd, about this plan of universal destruction
Yes, added another, and the balance of nature
It just  seemed to  us that if the whole of the rest of the Universe is destroyed
it will somehow upset the balance of nature
We're quite keen  on ecology, you see
His voice trailed away unhappily
And sport, said another, loudly
This got a cheer  of  approval from the others
Yes, agreed the first, and sport
He looked  back  at  his fellows  uneasily  and scratched fitfully at his cheek
He seemed
to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion, as if  everything he  wanted  to  say  and  everything  he  thought  were  entirely different  things,  between  which  he  could  see  no   possible connection
You see, he mumbled, some of us
and  he  looked  around again as if for confirmation
The others made encouraging noises
Some of us, he continued, are  quite  keen  to  have  sporting links  with  the  rest  of  the  Galaxy, and though I can see the argument about keeping sport out of politics, I think that if  we want to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we do, then it's probably a mistake to destroy it
And  indeed  the
rest of the Universe
his voice trailed away again
which is what seems to be the idea now
Wh
said Slartibartfast
Wh
Hhhh
said Arthur
Dr
said Ford Prefect
OK, said Trillian
Let's talk about it
She  walked  forward and  took the poor confused Krikkiter by the arm
He looked about
twenty-five, which meant, because of the  peculiar  manglings  of time that had been going on in this area, that he would have been just twenty when the Krikkit  Wars  were  finished,  ten  billion years ago
Trillian led him for a short walk through the  torchlight  before she  said  anything  more
He stumbled uncertainly after her
The
encircling torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating  to this strange, quiet girl who alone in the Universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing
She turned and faced him, and lightly held both his arms
He  was a picture of bewildered misery
Tell me, she said
He said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one  of her eyes to the other
We
he said, we have to be alone
I think
He  screwed up  his  face  and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like
someone trying to shake a coin out of a money box
He  looked  up again
We  have  this bomb now, you see, he said, it's just a
little one
I know, she said
He goggled at her as if she'd said something very  strange  about beetroots
Honestly, he said, it's very, very little
I know, she said again
But they say, his voice trailed on, they say  it  can  destroy everything that exists
And we have to do that, you see, I think
Will that make us alone
I  don't  know
It  seems  to  be  our function, though, he said, and dropped his head again
Whatever that means, said a hollow voice from the crowd
Trillian slowly put her arms around  the  poor  bewildered  young Krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder
It's all right, she said quietly but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd to hear, you don't have to do it
She rocked him
You don't have to do it, she said again
She let him go and stood back
I want you to do something for me, she said,  and  unexpectedly laughed
I want, she said, and laughed again
She put her hand over  her mouth  and then said with a straight face, I want you to take me
to your leader, and she pointed into the War Zones in  the  sky
She seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there
Her laughter seemed to discharge  something  in  the  atmosphere
From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to sing a tune which would  have  enabled  Paul  McCartney,  had  he written it, to buy the world
Zaphod Beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like  the  hell of  a  guy  he  was
He was very confused, but continued crawling
doggedly anyway because he was that brave
He was confused by something he had just seen, but  not  half  as confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear, so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was
He was in the Robot War Zones many miles above the surface of the planet Krikkit
The atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from  any rays or anything which space might care to hurl in his direction
He had parked  the  starship  Heart  of  Gold  amongst  the  huge jostling  dim  hulks that crowded the sky here above Krikkit, and had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky buildings, armed with nothing but a Zap gun and something for his headaches
He had found himself in a long, wide and badly  lit  corridor  in which  he  was able to hide until he worked out what he was going to do next
He hid because every now and then one of the  Krikkit
robots  would  walk along it, and although he had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands, it had nevertheless been  an extremely  painful  one,  and he had no desire to stretch what he was only half-inclined to call his good fortune
He  had  ducked, at one  point,  into  a  room  leading  off  the corridor,  and  had  discovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly lit chamber
In fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit - the wreckage  of a spacecraft
It was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he
had caught up with some of the Galactic  history  he  had  missed through  his  failed  attempts  to  have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him at school, he was  able  to  put  in  an intelligent  guess  that this was the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through the Dust Cloud all those billions  of  years  ago and started the whole business off
But, and  this  is  where  he  had  become  confused,  there  was something not at all right about it
It was genuinely wrecked
It was genuinely burnt,  but  a  fairly brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a
genuine spacecraft
It was as if it was a full-scale model of one - a solid blueprint
In other words it was a very useful thing to
have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself and  didn't know how to do it
It was not, however, anything that
would ever fly anywhere itself
He was still puzzling over this - in fact he'd only just  started to  puzzle  over  it  - when he became aware that a door had slid open in another part  of  the  chamber,  and  another  couple  of Krikkit robots had entered, looking a little glum
Zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding  that  just as  discretion was the better part of valour so was cowardice the better  part  of  discretion,  he  valiantly  hid  himself  in  a cupboard
The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top  part  of  a  shaft which   led   down  through  an  inspection  hatch  into  a  wide ventilation tunnel
He led himself down into it  and  started  to
crawl along it, which is where we found him
He  didn't  like  it
It   was   cold,   dark   and   profoundly uncomfortable,  and it frightened him
At the first opportunity -
which was another shaft  a  hundred  yards  further  along  -  he climbed back up out of it
This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to be a computer intelligence centre
He emerged in a dark narrow space
between a large computer bank and the wall
He quickly learned that he was  not  alone  in  the  chamber  and started  to leave again, when he began to listen with interest to what the other occupants were saying
It's the robots, sir, said one voice
There's something  wrong with them
What, exactly
These were the voices of two War Command Krikkiters
All the  War
Commanders  lived  up in the sky in the Robot War Zones, and were largely immune to the whimsical doubts  and  uncertainties  which were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet
Well, sir I think it's just as well that they are  being  phased out  of the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the supernova bomb
In the very short time  since  we  were  released
from the envelope - Get to the point
The robots aren't enjoying it, sir
What
The war, sir, it seems  to  be  getting  them  down
There's  a certain  world-weariness  about  them,  or  perhaps  I should say
Universe-weariness
Well, that's all right, they're meant to be helping  to  destroy
it
Yes, well they're finding it difficult, sir
They are  afflicted
with  a  certain  lassitude
They're just finding it hard to get behind the job
They lack oomph
What are you trying to say
Well, I think they're very depressed about something, sir
What on Krikkit are you talking about
Well, in the few skirmishes they've had recently, it seems  that
they  go  into  battle,  raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think, why bother
What, cosmically speaking, is  it  all  about
And they just seem to get a little tired and a little grim
And then what do they do
Er, quadratic equations mostly, sir
Fiendishly  difficult  ones by all accounts
And then they sulk
Sulk
Yes, sir
Whoever heard of a robot sulking
I don't know, sir
What was that noise
It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his head spinning
In a deep well of darkness a crippled  robot  sat
It  had  been silent  in  its  metallic darkness for some time
It was cold and
damp, but being a robot it was supposed not to be able to  notice these  things
With  an enormous effort of will, however, it did
manage to notice them
Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core  of the  Krikkit War Computer
It wasn't enjoying the experience, and
neither was the central intelligence  core  of  the  Krikkit  War Computer
The  Krikkit  robots  which  had  salvaged  this  pathetic  metal creature  from  the  swamps of Squornshellous Zeta had recognized almost immediately its gigantic intelligence, and the  use  which this could be to them
They hadn't reckoned with the  attendant  personality  disorders, which  the  coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease
It was not happy with its task
Apart from anything else, the  mere  coordination  of  an  entire planet's  military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its formidable mind, and the rest of it had become  extremely  bored
Having  solved  all  the  major mathematical, physical, chemical, biological,    sociological,     philosophical,     etymological, meteorological  and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three times over, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone, or indeed tune
The latest one was a lullaby
Now the world has gone to bed, Marvin droned, Darkness won't engulf my head, I can see by infra-red, How I hate the night
He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle the next verse
Now I lay me down to sleep, Try to count electric sheep, Sweet dream wishes you can keep, How I hate the night
Marvin
hissed a voice
His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate  network  of electrodes  which  connected  him  to  the  central  Krikkit  War Computer
An inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly  heads was  peering  through  whilst  the  other  kept  on jogging it by continually  darting  to  look  this  way  and   that   extremely nervously
Oh, it's you, muttered the robot
I might have known
Hey, kid, said Zaphod in astonishment, was  that  you  singing
just then
I  am,   Marvin   acknowledged   bitterly,   in   particularly
scintillating form at the moment
Zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around
Are you alone
he said
Yes, said Marvin
Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my  only companions
And vast intelligence of course
And infinite sorrow
And
Yeah, said Zaphod
Hey, what's your connection with all this
This, said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the electrodes which connected him with the Krikkit computer
Then, said Zaphod awkwardly, I guess you must  have  saved  my life
Twice
Three times, said Marvin
Zaphod's head snapped round (his other one was looking  hawkishly in  entirely  the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal killer robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke
It
staggered  backwards and slumped against a wall
It slid down it
It slipped sideways, threw its  head  back  and  started  to  sob inconsolably
Zaphod looked back at Marvin
You must have a terrific outlook on life, he said
Just don't even ask, said Marvin
I won't, said Zaphod, and didn't
Hey look, he added, you're doing a terrific job
Which means, I suppose, said Marvin,  requiring  only  one  ten thousand  million  billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to make this particular logical  leap,  that  you're  not going to release me or anything like that
Kid, you know I'd love to
But you're not going to
No
I see
You're working well
Yes, said Marvin
Why stop now just when I'm hating it
I got to find Trillian and the guys
Hey,  you  any  idea  where they  are
I mean, I just got a planet to choose from
Could take
a while
They are very close, said Marvin dolefully
You  can  monitor
them from here if you like
I better go get them, asserted Zaphod
Er,  maybe  they  need
some help, right
Maybe, said Marvin with unexpected authority in his  lugubrious
voice,  it would be better if you monitored them from here
That young  girl,  he  added  unexpectedly,  is  one  of  the  least
benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting
Zaphod took a  moment  or  two  to  find  his  way  through  this labyrinthine  string  of  negatives  and emerged at the other end with surprise
Trillian
he  said
She's  just  a  kid
Cute,  yeah,   but temperamental
You  know  how  it  is with women
Or perhaps you
don't
I assume you don't
If you do I don't want to  hear  about it
Plug us in
totally manipulated
What
said Zaphod
It was Trillian speaking
He turned round
The wall against which the Krikkit robot was sobbing had  lit  up to  reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the Krikkit Robot War zones
It seemed to be  a  council  chamber  of
some  kind  -  Zaphod couldn't make it out too clearly because of the robot slumped against the screen
He tried to move the robot, but it was heavy with its  grief  and tried to bite him, so he just looked around as best he could
Just think about it, said Trillian's voice,  your  history  is just  a  series  of  freakishly  improbable events
And I know an
improbable event when I see one
Your complete isolation from the Galaxy  was freakish for a start
Right out on the very edge with
a Dust Cloud around you
It's a set-up
Obviously
Zaphod was mad with  frustration  because  he  couldn't  see  the
screen
The  robot's  head  was obscuring his view of the people Trillian as  talking  to,  his  multi-functional  battleclub  was
obscuring the background, and the elbow of the arm it had pressed tragically against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself
Then, said Trillian, this spaceship that crash-landed on  your planet
That's really likely, isn't it
Have you any idea of what
the  odds  are  against   a   drifting   spaceship   accidentally intersecting with the orbit of a planet
Hey, said Zaphod, she doesn't know what the zark she's talking about
I've seen that spaceship
It's a fake
No deal
I thought it might be,  said  Marvin  from  his  prison  behind Zaphod
Oh yeah, said Zaphod
It's easy for you to say  that
I  just told you
Anyway, I don't see what it's got to do with anything
And  especially,  continued  Trillian,  the  odds  against  it intersecting  with  the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or the whole of the Universe as far as I know, that would be totally traumatized  to  see it
You don't know what the odds are
Nor do
I, they're  that  big
Again,  it's  a  set-up
I  wouldn't  be surprised if that spaceship was just a fake
Zaphod managed to move the robot's battleclub
Behind it  on  the screen  were  the  figures of Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast who
appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing
Hey, look, said Zaphod excitedly
The guys are doing great
Ra ra ra
Go get 'em, guys
And  what  about,  said  Trillian,  all  this  technology  you suddenly  managed  to build for yourselves almost overnight
Most
people would take thousands of years to do all that
Someone  was feeding  you  what you needed to know, someone was keeping you at
it
I  know,  I  know,  she  added  in  response   to   an   unseen interruption, I know you didn't realize it was going on
This is
exactly my point
You never realized anything at all
Like  this Supernova Bomb
How do you know about that
said an unseen voice
I just know, said Trillian
You expect me to believe that  you are  bright  enough to invent something that brilliant and be too
dumb to realize it would take you with it  as  well
That's  not just stupid, that is spectacularly obtuse
Hey, what's this bomb thing
said Zaphod in alarm to Marvin
The supernova bomb
said  Marvin
It's  a  very,  very  small bomb
Yeah
That would destroy the Universe in toto,  added  Marvin
Good
idea, if you ask me
They won't get it to work, though
Why not, if it's so brilliant
It's brilliant, said Marvin, they're not
They got as  far  as designing  it  before  they  were locked in the envelope
They've
spent the last five years building it
They think they've got  it right  but  they  haven't
They're as stupid as any other organic
life form
I hate them
Trillian was continuing
Zaphod tried to pull the Krikkit robot away by its  leg,  but  it kicked  and growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing
Then  suddenly  it  slumped  over  and  continued  to
express its feelings out of everybody's way on the floor
Trillian was standing alone in the middle of  the  chamber  tired out but with fiercely burning eyes
Ranged in front of her were the  pale-faced  and  wrinkled  Elder Masters of Krikkit, motionless behind their widely curved control desk, staring at her with helpless fear and hatred
In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and  the middle  of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim white pillar about four feet tall
On top of  it  stood  a
small white globe, about three, maybe four inches in diameter
Beside  it  stood  a  Krikkit  robot  with  its  multi-functional battleclub
In fact, explained Trillian, you are so dumb stupid (She  was sweating
Zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her
to be doing at this point) you are all so  dumb  stupid  that  I doubt, I very much doubt, that you've been able to build the bomb properly without any help from Hactar for the last five years
Who's this guy Hactar
said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders
If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn't hear him
All his attention  was concentrated on the screen
One of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion  with  his  hand towards the Krikkit robot
The robot raised his club
There's nothing I can do, said Marvin
It's on an  independent circuit from the others
Wait, said Trillian
The Elder  made  a  small  motion
The  robot  halted
Trillian suddenly seemed very doubtful of her own judgment
How do you know all this
said Zaphod to Marvin at this point
Computer records, said Marvin
I have access
You're very different, aren't you, said Trillian to  the  Elder
Masters,  from your fellow worldlings down on the ground
You've spent all your lives up  here,  unprotected  by  the  atmosphere
You've  been  very  vulnerable
The  rest  of  your race is very frightened, you know, they don't want you to do this
You're  out
of touch, why don't you check up
The Krikkit Elder grew impatient
He made a gesture to the  robot
which  was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it
The robot swung its battleclub
It hit the small white globe
The small white globe was the supernova bomb
It was a very, very small bomb which was designed  to  bring  the entire Universe to an end
The supernova bomb flew through the air
It hit the back wall  of the council chamber and dented it very badly
So how does she know all this
said Zaphod
Marvin kept a sullen silence
Probably just bluffing, said Zaphod
Poor kid, I should  never have left her alone
Hactar
called Trillian
What are you up to
There was no reply from the enclosing darkness
Trillian  waited,
nervously
She  was  sure that she couldn't be wrong
She peered into the gloom from which she had been  expecting  some  kind  of
response
But there was only cold silence
Hactar
she called again
I would like you to meet  my  friend Arthur  Dent
I  wanted  to  go  off  with a Thunder God, but he
wouldn't let me and I appreciate that
He made me  realize  where my  affections really lay
Unfortunately Zaphod is too frightened
by all this, so I brought Arthur instead
I'm not  sure  why  I'm telling you all this
Hello
she said again
Hactar
And then it came
It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind  from  a great distance, half heard, a memory of a dream of a voice
Won't you both come out, said the voice
I  promise  that  you will be perfectly safe
They glanced at each other, and  then  stepped  out,  improbably, along  the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway of the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of  the  Dust Cloud
Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she wouldn't let him
He held on to his airline hold-all with its tin
of Greek  olive  oil,  its  towel,  its  crumpled  postcards   of Santorini  and its other odds and ends
He steadied and reassured
that instead
They were standing on, and in, nothing
Murky, dusty nothing
Each  grain  of  dust  of  the  pulverized computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching
the sunlight in the darkness
Each particle of the computer, each speck  of  dust,  held  within  itself,  faintly  and weakly, the
pattern of the whole
In  reducing  the  computer  to  dust  the Silastic   Armorfiends  of  Striterax  had  merely  crippled  the
computer, not killed it
A weak and insubstantial field held  the particles in slight relationships with each other
Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in  the  middle  of this  bizarre  entity
They  had nothing to breathe, but for the
moment this seemed not to matter
Hactar kept his  promise
They were safe
For the moment
I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality, said  Hactar faintly,  but  tricks  of  the  light
It  is  possible  to  be
comfortable with tricks of the light, though, if that is all  you have
His voice evanesced, and in the dark dust a long velvet  paisley- covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape
Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric Earth
He wanted
to shout and shake with rage that the Universe kept  doing  these insanely bewildering things to him
He let  this  feeling  subside,  and  then  sat  on  the  sofa  - carefully
Trillian sat on it too
It was real
At least, if it wasn't real, it did support them, and as that  is what  sofas  are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered, was a real sofa
The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again
I hope you are comfortable, it said
They nodded
And I would like to congratulate you on  the  accuracy  of  your deductions
Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn't deduced  anything  much himself,  Trillian  was  the  one
She had simply asked him along
because he was interested in life, the Universe, and everything
That is something  in  which  I  too  am  interested,  breathed Hactar
Well, said Arthur, we should have a chat  about  it  sometime
Over a cup of tea
There slowly materialized in front of them a small  wooden  table
on which sat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china sugar bowl, and two bone china cups and saucers
Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the  light
He  leaned  back  on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was prepared to accept as comfortable
Why, said Trillian, do  you  feel  you  have  to  destroy  the Universe
She found it a little difficult talking  into  nothingness,  with nothing  on  which  to  focus
Hactar obviously noticed this
He
chuckled a ghostly chuckle
If it's going to be that sort of session, he said, we  may  as well have the right sort of setting
And now there materialized in front of them something new
It was the  dim  hazy  image  of  a  couch - a psychiatrist's couch
The
leather with which it was upholstered was  shiny  and  sumptuous, but again, it was only a trick of the light
Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion  of wood-panelled  walls
And then, on the couch, appeared the image
of Hactar himself, and it was an eye-twisting image
The couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist's couch  -  about five or six feet long
The computer looked normal size for a black space-borne  computer satellite - about a thousand miles across
The illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the thing which made the eyes twist
All right, said Trillian firmly
She stood up off the sofa
She felt  that  she  was  being  asked to feel too comfortable and to
accept too many illusions
Very good, she said
Can you construct real things too
I mean solid objects
Again there was a pause before the answer, as if  the  pulverized mind  of Hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over which it was scattered
Ah, he sighed
You are thinking of the spaceship
Thoughts seemed to drift by them and  through  them,  like  waves
through the ether
Yes, he acknowledge, I can
But it takes enormous effort and time
All I can do  in  my
particle  state, you see, is encourage and suggest
Encourage and suggest
And suggest
The image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and  waver,  as if finding it hard to maintain itself
It gathered new strength
I can encourage and suggest, it said,  tiny  pieces  of  space debris  -  the  odd  minute  meteor,  a few molecules here, a few hydrogen atoms  there  -  to  move  together
I  encourage  them
together
I can tease them into shape, but it takes many aeons
So, did you make, asked  Trillian  again,  the  model  of  the
wrecked spacecraft
Er
yes, murmured Hactar
I have made
a few  things
I
can  move  them  about
I made the spacecraft
It seemed best to do
Something then made Arthur pick up his hold-all from where he had left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly
The mist of Hactar's ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy dreams were moving through it
I repented, you see, he  murmured  dolefully
I  repented  of sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armorfiends
It was not
my place to make such decisions
I  was  created  to  fulfill  a function and I failed in it
I negated my own existence
Hactar sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his story
You were right, he said at length
I deliberately nurtured the planet  of  Krikkit  till  they would arrive at the same state of
mind as the Silastic Armorfiends, and require of me the design of the bomb I failed to make the first time
I wrapped myself around
the planet and coddled it
Under the influence of  events  I  was able  to  generate,  they  learned to hate like maniacs
I had to
make them live in the sky
On the ground my influences  were  too weak
Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in the envelope  of  Slo-Time,  their responses became very confused and they were unable to manage
Ah well, ah well, he added, I was only trying  to  fulfill  my function
And very gradually, very, very slowly, the images  in  the  cloud began to fade, gently to melt away
And then, suddenly, they stopped fading
There was also the matter of revenge, of course,  said  Hactar, with a sharpness which was new in his voice
Remember, he said, that I was pulverized, and then left  in  a crippled  and  semi-impotent  state  for  billions  of  years
I
honestly would rather wipe out the Universe
You would  feel  the same way, believe me
He paused again, as eddies swept through the Dust
But primarily, he said in his  former,  wistful  tone,  I  was trying to fulfill my function
Ah well
Trillian said, Does it worry you that you have failed
Have I failed
whispered Hactar
The image of the  computer  on
the psychiatrist's couch began slowly to fade again
Ah well, ah well, the fading voice intoned again
No,  failure doesn't bother me now
You know what we have to do
said Trillian, her voice cold  and businesslike
Yes, said Hactar, you're going to disperse me
You  are  going to destroy my consciousness
Please be my guest - after all these
aeons, oblivion is all I crave
If I haven't already fulfilled my function, then it's too late now
Thank you and good night
The sofa vanished
The tea table vanished
The couch and the computer vanished
the walls were gone
Arthur and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold
Well, that, said Arthur, would appear to be that
The flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided
A few
last  licks  and  they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of Ashes, where a few minutes previously there had been  the  Wooden Pillar of Nature and Spirituality
He  scooped  them  off  the hob of  the  Heart  of  Gold's  Gamma barbecue,  put  them  in  a  paper  bag, and walked back into the bridge
I think we should take them back, he said
I  feel  that  very strongly
He had already  had  an  argument  with  Slartibartfast  on  this matter,  and  eventually the old man had got annoyed and left
he
had returned to his own ship the Bistromath, had  a  furious  row with  the  waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what space was
The argument had arisen because Arthur's idea  of  returning  the Ashes  to Lord's Cricket Ground at the same moment that they were originally taken would involve travelling back in time a  day  or so,   and   this   was  precisely  the  sort  of  gratuitous  and irresponsible mucking about that the Campaign for Real  Time  was trying to put a stop to
Yes, Arthur had said, but you try  and  explain  that  to  the MCC, and he would hear no more against the idea
I think, he said again, and stopped
The reason he  started  to say  it  again  was  because no one had listened to him the first
time, and the reason he stopped  was  because  it  looked  fairly clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either
Ford, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visiscreens  intently as  Hactar  was  dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the Heart of Gold was pumping into it
What did it say
asked Ford
I thought I heard it say, said  Trillian  in  a  puzzle  voice, `What's done is done
I have fulfilled my function
I think we should take these back, said Arthur holding  up  the bag containing the Ashes
I feel that very strongly
The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc
Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the  wake  of the  theft of the Ashes by the Krikkit robots
Through the smoke,
people were running panicstricken,  colliding  with  each  other, tripping over stretchers, being arrested
One policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger  the  Infinitely Prolonged  for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall grey-green alien from returning to his ship  and  arrogantly flying away, thus causing even more panic and pandemonium
In the middle of this, for the second time  that  afternoon,  the figures  of  Arthur  Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized, they had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold which  was  now in parking orbit round the planet
I can explain, shouted Arthur
I have the  Ashes
They're  in this bag
I don't think you have their attention, said Ford
I have also helped save the Universe, called Arthur  to  anyone who was prepared to listen, in other words no one
That should have been a crowd-stopper, said Arthur to Ford
It wasn't, said Ford
Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past
Excuse me, he said
The Ashes
I've got them
They were stolen by  those  white  robots a moment ago
I've got them in this bag
They were part of the Key to the Slo-Time envelope, you see, and, well,  anyway  you can guess the rest, the point is I've got them and what should I do with them
The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he  was speaking metaphorically
He wandered about disconsolately
Is no one interested
he shouted out
A man rushed past him and jogged  his  elbow,  he  dropped  the  paper bag and it spilt its
contents all over the ground
Arthur stared down  at  it  with  a tight-set mouth
Ford looked at him
Wanna go now
he said
Arthur heaved a heavy sigh
He looked around at the planet Earth, for what he was now certain would be the last time
OK, he said
At that moment, through the clearing smoke, he  caught  sight  of one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything
Hold on a moment, he said to Ford
When I was a boy
Can you tell me later
I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn't very good at it
Or not at all, if you prefer
And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl
at Lord's
He looked around him at the  panicstricken  throng
No  one  was
going to mind very much
OK, said Ford wearily
Get it  over  with
I  shall  be  over there,  he added, being bored
He went and sat down on a patch
of smoking grass
Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon, the  cricket  ball  had actually landed in his bag, and he looked through the bag
He  had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it wasn't  the  same bag that he'd had at the time
Still, there the
ball was amongst his souvenirs of Greece
He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat  on  it  and polished  it  again
He put the bag down
He was going to do this
properly
He tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling  its weight
With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern,  he  trotted off  away  from  the  wicket
A medium-fast pace, he decided, and
measured a good long run-up
He looked up into the sky
The birds were wheeling  about  it,  a few  white  clouds  scudded across it
The air was disturbed with
the sounds of police and ambulance sirens, and  people  screaming and yelling, but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all
He was going to bowl a ball at Lord's
He turned and pawed a couple of times  at  the  ground  with  his bedroom  slippers
He  squared his shoulders, tossed the ball in
the air and caught it again
He started to run
As he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman
Oh, good, he thought, that should add a little
Then, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw  more  clearly
The  batsman  standing  ready  at  the  wicket was not one of the England cricket team
He was not one of  the  Australian  cricket
team
It was one of the robot Krikkit team
It was a cold, hard, lethal white killer-robot that presumably had not returned to its
ship with the others
Quite a few thoughts  collided  in  Arthur  Dent's  mind  at  tis moment,  but  he  didn't  seem  to  be able to stop running
Time
seemed to be going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn't seem to be able to stop running
Moving as if through syrup, he slowly turned  his  troubled  head and  looked at his own hand, the hand which was holding the small hard red ball
His feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he  stared at  the ball gripped in his helpless hand
It was emitting a deep
red glow and flashing intermittently
And  still  his  feet  were pounding inexorably forward
He looked at the Krikkit robot again  standing  implacably  still and purposefully in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness
Its eyes were burning with a deep  cold  fascinating  light,  and Arthur  could  not  move  his own eyes from them
He seemed to be
looking down a tunnel at them - nothing on either side seemed  to exist
Some of the thoughts which were colliding in  his  mind  at  this time were these: He felt a hell of a fool
He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully  to  a number  of  things  he  had heard said, phrases which now pounded round in his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point  where he  would  inevitably  release the ball to the Krikkit robot, who would inevitably strike it
He remembered Hactar saying,  Have  I  failed
Failure  doesn't bother me
He remembered the account of Hactar's dying words,  What's  done is done, I have fulfilled my function
He remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to  make  a  few things
He remembered the sudden movement in his hold-all that  had  made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the Dust Cloud
He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days to come to Lord's again
He also remembered that he wasn't a very good bowler
He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly  on  to  the  ball which  he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb that Hactar had built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would  cause the Universe to come to an abrupt and premature end
He hoped and prayed that  there  wasn't  an  afterlife
Then  he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped
that there wasn't an afterlife
He would feel very, very embarrassed meeting everybody
He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as  bad  as  he remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this moment and universal oblivion
He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he  felt his  feet connecting with the airline hold-all he'd stupidly left lying on the ground in front of  him,  he  felt  himself  falling heavily  forward  but,  having his mind so terribly full of other things at this moment, he completely  forgot  about  hitting  the ground and didn't
Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into the air whimpering with surprise
He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control
He twisted down towards the ground, flinging  himself  hectically through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into the distance
He hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind
It still  had its  multi-functional  battleclub  raised,  but had suddenly been
deprived of anything to hit
With a sudden mad access of strength, he wrestled the  battleclub from  the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn in the air, hurtled back down in a furious  power-drive  and with  one  crazy  swing knocked the robot's head from the robot's shoulders
Are you coming now
said Ford
Epilogue: Life, the Universe and Everything And at the end they travelled again
There was a time when Arthur Dent would not
He  said  that  the Bistromathic  Drive  had  revealed  to him that time and distance
were one, that mind and Universe were one,  that  perception  and reality  were  one,  and that the more one travelled the more one stayed in one place, and that what with one thing and another  he would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his mind, which was now at one with the Universe so it shouldn't take too  long,  and  he  could  get  a good rest afterwards, put in a little flying practice and learn to  cook  which  he  had  always meant  to  do
The can of Greek olive oil was now his most prized
possession, and he said that the way it had  unexpectedly  turned up in his life had again given him a certain sense of the oneness of things which made him feel that
He yawned and fell asleep
In the morning as they prepared to take him  to  some  quiet  and idyllic  planet  where  they  wouldn't mind him talking like that they suddenly picked  up  a  computer-driven  distress  call  and diverted to investigate
A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the  Merida  class seemed  to  be  dancing  a strange little jig through the void
A
brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer was fine, but that its pilot was mad
Half-mad, half-mad, the  man  insisted  as  they  carried  him, raving, aboard
He was a journalist  with  the  Siderial  Daily  Mentioner
They sedated  him  and  sent  Marvin  in  to keep him company until he
promised to try and talk sense
I was covering a trial, he said at last, on Argabuthon
He pushed himself up on to his thin wasted  shoulders,  his  eyes
stared  wildly
His white hair seemed to be waving at someone it knew in the next room
Easy, easy, said Ford
Trillian put  a  soothing  hand  on  his shoulder
The man sank back down again and stared at  the  ceiling  of  the ship's sick bay
The case, he said, is now immaterial, but there was a  witness
a  witness
a man called
called Prak
A strange and
difficult man
They were eventually forced to administer  a  drug to make him tell the truth, a truth drug
His eyes rolled helplessly in his head
They gave him too much, he said in a tiny whimper
They  gave him  much  too much
He started to cry
I thing the robots must
have jogged the surgeon's arm
Robots
said Zaphod sharply
What robots
Some white robots, whispered the man hoarsely, broke into  the courtroom  and  stole the judge's sceptre, the Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice, nasty Perspex thing
I don't  know  why  they  wanted
it
He  began  to  cry  again
And  I  think  they jogged the surgeon's arm
He shook his head loosely from side to side,  helplessly,  sadly, his eyes screwed up in pain
And when the trial continued, he said  in  a  weeping  whisper, they  asked  Prak  a most unfortunate thing
They asked him, he
paused and shivered, to tell the  Truth,  the  Whole  Truth  and Nothing but the Truth
Only, don't you see
He suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted at them
They'd given him much too much of the drug
He collapsed again, moaning quietly
Much too much too much  too
much too
The group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other
there
were goose pimples on backs
What happened
said Zaphod at last
Oh, he told it all right, said the man  savagely,  for  all  I know  he's  still  telling  it  now
Strange, terrible things
terrible, terrible
he screamed
They tried to calm him, but he struggled to his elbows again
Terrible things, incomprehensible things, he  shouted,  things that would drive a man mad
He stared wildly at them
Or in my case, he said, half-mad
I'm a journalist
You  mean,  said  Arthur  quietly,  that  you  are   used   to
confronting the truth
No, said the man with a puzzled frown
I mean that I  made  an
excuse and left early
He collapsed into a coma from which he recovered  only  once  and
briefly
On that one occasion, they discovered from him the following: When it became clear that Prak could not be  stopped,  that  here was truth in its absolute and final form, the court was cleared
Not only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prak still in it
Steel walls  were  erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side,
barbed wire, electric fences, crocodile swamps  and  three  major armies  were  installed,  so  that no one would ever have to hear Prak speak
That's a pity, said Arthur
I'd like to hear what  he  had  to say
Presumably  he would know what the Ultimate Question to the
Ultimate Answer is
It's always bothered me that we  never  found out
Think of a number, said the computer,  any number
Arthur told the computer the telephone  number  of  King's  Cross
railway  station passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must have some function, and this might turn out to be it
The computer injected the number into  the  ship's  reconstituted Improbability Drive
In Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and  Space  tells Matter how to move
The Heart of Gold told space to get knotted,  and  parked  itself neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the Argabuthon Chamber of Law
The courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber, clearly designed for Justice rather than, for instance, for Pleasure
You
wouldn't hold a dinner party here - at least,  not  a  successful one
The decor would get your guests down
The ceilings were high, vaulted and  very  dark
Shadows  lurked there  with  grim  determination
The panelling for the walls and
benches, the cladding of the heavy pillars, all were carved  from the  darkest  and  most  severe  trees  in the fearsome Forest of Arglebard
The massive black Podium of  Justice  which  dominated
the  centre of the chamber was a monster of gravity
If a sunbeam had ever managed to slink this far into the  Justice  complex  of
Argabuthon  it  would  have turned around and slunk straight back out again
Arthur and Trillian were the first in,  whilst  Ford  and  Zaphod bravely kept a watch on their rear
At first it seemed totally dark  and  deserted
their  footsteps echoed  hollowly  round the chamber
This seemed curious
All the
defences were still in position and operative around the  outside of  the  building,  they had run scan checks
Therefore, they had
assumed, the truth-telling must still be going on
But there was nothing
Then, as their eyes  became  accustomed  to  the  darkness,  they spotted  a  dull red glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live shadow
They swung a torch round on to it
Prak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette
Hi, he said, with a little half-wave
His voice echoed  through the  chamber
He was a little man with scraggy hair
He sat with
his shoulders  hunched  forward  and  his  head  and  knees  kept jiggling
He took a drag of his cigarette
They stared at him
What's going on
said Trillian
Nothing, said the man and jiggled his shoulders
Arthur shone his torch full on Prak's face
We thought, he said, that you were meant  to  be  telling  the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth
Oh, that, said Prak
Yeah
I  was
I  finished
There's  not nearly  as  much  of  it  as  people imagine
Some of it's pretty
funny, though
He suddenly exploded in about three seconds of  manical  laughter
and  stopped again
he sat there, jiggling his head and knees
He dragged on his cigarette with a strange half-smile
Ford and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows
Tell us about it, said Ford
Oh, I can't remember any of it now, said Prak
I  thought  of writing  some of it down, but first I couldn't find a pencil, and
then I thought, why bother
There was a long silence, during which they  thought  they  could
feel the Universe age a little
Prak stared into the torchlight
None of it
said Arthur at last
You can remember none of it
No
Except most of the good bits were about  frogs,  I  remember
that
Suddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet
on the ground
You would not believe  some  of  the  things  about  frogs,  he gasped
Come on let's go and find ourselves a frog
Boy, will I
ever see them in a new light
He leapt to his  feet  and  did  a tiny  little  dance
Then he stopped and took a long drag at his
cigarette
Let's find a frog I can laugh at, he said simply
Anyway,  who are you guys
We came to find you, said Trillian,  deliberately  not  keeping the disappointment out of her voice
My name is Trillian
Prak jiggled his head
Ford Prefect, said Ford Prefect with a shrug
Prak jiggled his head
And I, said Zaphod, when he judged that the  silence  was  once again  deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be tossed in lightly, am Zaphod Beeblebrox
Prak jiggled his head
Who's this guy
said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur,  who was standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts
Me
said Arthur
Oh, my name's Arthur Dent
Prak's eyes popped out of his head
No kidding
he yelped
You are Arthur Dent
The Arthur Dent
He staggered backwards, clutching his stomach and convulsed  with
fresh paroxysms o laughter
Hey, just think of meeting you
he gasped
Boy,  he  shouted, you are the most
wow, you just leave the frogs standing
he howled and screamed with laughter
He fell over  backwards  on to  the bench
He hollered and yelled in hysterics
He cried with
laughter, he kicked his legs in  the  air,  he  beat  his  chest
Gradually  he  subsided, panting
He looked at them
He looked at Arthur
He fell back again howling with laughter
Eventually  he
fell asleep
Arthur stood there with his  lips  twitching  whilst  the  others carried Prak comatose on to the ship
Before we picked up Prak, said Arthur, I was going to leave
I still want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible
The others nodded in silence, a silence which was  only  slightly undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical laughter which came drifting from Prak's cabin  at  the  farthest end of the ship
We have questioned him, continued Arthur,  or  at  least,  you have  questioned  him  -  I,  as you know, can't go near him - on everything, and he  doesn't  really  seem  to  have  anything  to contribute
Just the occasional snippet, and things I don't want
to hear about frogs
The others tried not to smirk
Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke, said Arthur and  then had to wait for the others to stop laughing
I am the first
he stopped again
This time he  stopped  and listened  to  the  silence
There actually was silence this time,
and it had come very suddenly
Prak was quiet
For days they had  lived  with  constant  manical laughter  ringing  round  the ship, only occasionally relieved by
short periods of light giggling and sleep
Arthur's very soul was clenched with paranoia
This was not the silence of sleep
A buzzer sounded
A glance  at a board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak
He's not well, said Trillian quietly
The constant laughing is completely wrecking his body
Arthur's lips twitched but he said nothing
We'd better go and see him, said Trillian
Trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face
He wants you to go in, she said to Arthur, who was wearing  his glum  and  tight-lipped  one
He  thrust his hands deep into his
dressing-gown pockets and tried to  think  of  something  to  say which  wouldn't  sound  petty
It seemed terribly unfair, but he
couldn't
Please, said Trillian
He shrugged and went in, taking his glum  and  tight-lipped  face with him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prak
He looked down at his tormentor, who was  lying  quietly  on  the bed,  ashen  and wasted
His breathing was very shallow
Ford and
Zaphod were standing by the bed looking awkward
You wanted to ask me something, said Prak in a thin  voice  and coughed slightly
Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided
How do you know that
he asked
Prak shrugged weakly
Cos it's true, he said simply
Arthur took the point
Yes, he said at last in rather a strained drawl
I did have  a question
Or rather, what I actually have is an Answer
I wanted
to know what the Question was
Prak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little
It's
well, it's a long story, he said, but the Question  I would like to know is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe
and Everything
All we know is  that  the  Answer  is  Forty-Two, which is a little aggravating
Prak nodded again
Forty-Two, he said
Yes, that's right
He paused
Shadows of thought and memory crossed  his  face  like
the shadows of clouds crossing the land
I'm afraid, he said at last, that the Question and the  Answer are  mutually  exclusive
Knowledge  of  one logically precludes
knowledge of the other
It is impossible that both  can  ever  be known about the same universe
He paused again
Disappointment  crept  into  Arthur's  face  and snuggled down into its accustomed place
Except, said Prak, struggling to sort a  thought  out,  if  it happened,  it  seems  that the Question and the Answer would just cancel each other out and take  the  Universe  with  them,  which would   then   be  replaced  by  something  even  more  bizarrely inexplicable
It is possible that this has already happened,  he
added  with  a  weak  smile,  but  there  is a certain amount of Uncertainty about it
A little giggle brushed through him
Arthur sat down on a stool
Oh well, he said with resignation, I  was  just  hoping  there would be some sort of reason
Do you know, said Prak, the story of the Reason
Arthur said that he didn't, and Prak said that he  knew  that  he
didn't
He told it
One night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of  a  planet which  had  never  seen one before
The planet was Dalforsas, the
ship was this one
It appeared as a  brilliant  new  star  moving silently across the heavens
Primitive  tribesmen  who  were  sitting  huddled  on  the   Cold Hillsides  looked up from their steaming night-drinks and pointed with trembling fingers, swearing that they had  seen  a  sign,  a sign from their gods which meant that they must now arise at last and go and slay the evil Princes of the Plains
In the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of  the  Plains looked  up and saw the shining star, and received it unmistakably as a sign from their gods that they must now go and set about the accursed Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides
And between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up  into  the sky  and  saw  the sigh of the new star, and saw it with fear and apprehension, for though they had never  seen  anything  like  it before,  they  too  knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they bowed their heads in despair
They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign
When the rains departed, it was a sign
When the winds rose, it was a sign
When the winds fell, it was a sign
When in the land there was born at midnight of a full moon a goat with three heads, that was a sign
When in the land there was born at some time in the  afternoon  a perfectly  normal  cat or pig with no birth complications at all, or even just a child with a retrousse nose, that too would  often be taken as a sign
So there was no doubt at all that a new star in  the  sky  was  a sign of a particularly spectacular order
And each new sign signified the same thing - that the Princes  of the  Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to beat the hell out of each other again
This in itself wouldn't be so bad, except that the Princes of the Plains  and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to beat the hell out of each other in the Forest, and it was  always the Dwellers in the Forest who came off worst in these exchanges, though as far as they could see it never had anything to do  with them
And sometimes, after some of the worst  of  these  outrages,  the Dwellers  in  the  Forest  would  send  a messenger to either the leader of the  Princes  of  the  Plains  or  the  leader  of  the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides and demand to know the reason for this intolerable behaviour
And the leader, whichever one it was, would  take  the  messenger aside  and  explain  the  Reason to him, slowly and carefully and with great attention to the considerable detail involved
And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one
It  was  very clear,  very  rational,  and  tough
The messenger would hang his
head and feel sad and foolish that he had  not  realized  what  a tough and complex place the real world was, and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it
Now do you understand
the leader would say
The messenger would nod dumbly
And you see these battles have to take place
Another dumb nod
And why they have to take place in the forest, and why it is  in everybody's  best  interest,  the  Forest Dwellers included, that they should
Er
In the long run
Er, yes
And the messenger did understand the Reason, and he  returned  to
his people in the Forest
But as he approached them, as he walked through the Forest and amongst the trees, he found  that  all  he
could  remember of the Reason was how terribly clear the argument had seemed
What it actually was he couldn't remember at all
And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the  Tribesmen and  the  Princes  came hacking and burning their way through the Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in their way
Prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically
I was the messenger, he said, after the  battles  precipitated by  the  appearance of your ship, which were particularly savage
Many of our people died
I thought I could bring the Reason back
I  went  and was told it by the leader of the Princes, but on the way back it slipped and melted away in my mind like snow  in  the sun
That was many years ago, and much has happened since then
He looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently
There is one other thing I can remember  from  the  truth  drug
Apart  from  the  frogs,  and  that  is God's last message to his creation
Would you like to hear it
For a moment they didn't know whether to take him seriously
Strue, he said
For real
I mean it
His chest heaved weakly and he struggled  for  breath
His  head
lolled slightly
I wasn't very impressed with it when I first knew what it  was, he  said,  but  now  I  think back to how impressed I was by the Prince's Reason, and how soon afterwards I couldn't recall it  at all,  I  think  it might be a lot more helpful
Would you like to
know what it is
Would you
They nodded dumbly
I bet you would
If you're that interested I suggest you go  and look for it
It is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on
top  of  the  Quentulus  Quazgar  Mountains  in   the   land   of Sevorbeupstry  on  the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun Zarss in Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma
It is guarded by the
Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob
There was a long silence following this announcement,  which  was
finally broken by Arthur
Sorry, it's where
he said
It is written, repeated Prak, in thirty-foot-high  letters  of fire  on  top  of  the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the
Sorry, said Arthur again, which mountains
The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry  on
the planet
Which land was that
I didn't quite catch it
Sevorbeupstry, on the planet
Sevorbe-what
Oh, for heaven's sake, said Prak and died testily
In the following days Arthur thought a little about this message, but  in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of finding  a  nice little world somewhere to settle down and lead a quiet retired life
Having saved the Universe twice in one day he
thought that he could take things a little easier from now on
They dropped him off on the planet Krikkit, which  was  now  once again   an   idyllic  pastoral  world,  even  if  the  songs  did occasionally get on his nerves
He spent a lot of time flying
He learnt to communicate with birds  and  discovered  that  their conversation was fantastically boring
It was all to do with wind
speed, wing spans, power-to-weight ratios and a  fair  bit  about berries
Unfortunately,  he  discovered,  once  you  have learnt
birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of  it the whole time, just inane bird chatter
There is no getting away
from it
For that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live  on  the  ground  and  love  it,  despite a lot of the inane chatter he heard down there as well
One day, he was walking through the fields  humming  a  ravishing tune  he'd  heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in front of him
A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall  grey-green  alien marched out and approached him
Arthur Phili
it said, then glanced sharply at him and  down at his clipboard
He frowned
He looked up at him again
I've done you before haven't I
he said
